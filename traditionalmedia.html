        <h4> Traditional Media</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> Although I'm passionately in love with MS Paint,
                    I'll always prefer traditional media.</p>
                <p> With biros,
                    it's possible to get a much more gradated effect with minimal effort.
                    (I will try to upload some clear examples in the future)
                    Pencils are similar,
                    although I try to avoid them,
                    as over the years,
                    pages drawn in pencil fade and rub away.</p>
                <p> I've kept drawing pads since I was 12 (just supermarket things);
                    I currently have two A3 pads in an attempt to learn to draw big
                    (and from the elbow)
                    and get better at lineart. So far,
                    I'm finding I just draw small pictures with a lot of space around them...</p>
                <p> I used to want to buy 'how to draw' books constantly;
                    I think I've got better at remembering adages about bad workmen and tools.
                    Perhaps others are familiar with that experience.</p>
                <p> I rarely colour; 
                    monochrome tends to look nicer to me.
                    That, and there's the omnipresent worry that I'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.
                    There's so much choice! And I always get it wrong!
                    But I have strong positive feelings
                    for burnt orange paired with turquoise
                    (or navy at a pinch).
                    When I dare, I use pencil crayons,
                    or sometimes watercolour pencils.
                    I don't really know how to get the most out of them yet.
                    So I use them much like regular colours,
                    but that can be blended if rubbed.
                </p>
                <p> I don't have a scanner in my house at the moment.
                    I should change that.</p>

        <p> This always happens. Eventually, you get used to your inevitable
            failure (and remember to take photos along the way)</p>
            
        <p> The most annoying thing is that there's no correlation between
            time-spent and quality-of-end-result. This Buffy doodle took 20 mins,
            and I'm not sure I've drawn anything better before or since:</p>

        <p> Portraits are my thing. And trying to draw 'realistically', even though pros
            find that boring. I like to obsess over the details.</p>
        <p> I used to feel bad that I only ever wanted to draw faces,
            and try to force myself to draw other things.
            I've now stopped caring. I'll draw what I like.</p>
        <p> I'd like to be good at landscapes but I am absymal.</p>
        <p> And I paint like a five year old,
            as 12-year-old me did not resolve to paint every day,
            and had the natural artistic skill of a five year old.</p>
