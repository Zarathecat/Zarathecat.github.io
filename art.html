        <h1>Drawings and Things</h1>
        <p> I draw sometimes.
            I normally use some combination of biros,
            pencil crayons,
            MS Paint
            and the occasional pencil.</p>
            <p>I love MS Paint dearly
            and consider it the epitome of perfection.</p>
            <p>So! I thought this page would be a handy place to put a gallery of sorts,
               and also in-progress things with explanations of my process,
               that sort of thing.</p>
            <p> I'm an amateur.
                Drawing interests me because I'm naturally very bad at it,
                and can't picture objects or images in my mind at all.</p>
            <p> When I was 12,
                I got so fed up with being so bad at it,
                that I bought *all* the 'how to draw manga' books,
                and I made myself draw every day.
                I kept that up,
                more or less,
                for some years.</p>
            <h2> Projects</h2>
            <h4> This Website </h4>
            <p> This is the obvious place to start!</p>
            <p> I have a picture on the homepage. At time of writing, it looks like this:</p>
            <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows-colour-2-eveneyes-2-small.png" class="img-circle" width="200" height="200">
            <p> I <i>wanted</i> a two-second MS Paint doodle of me.</p>
            <p> I forgot that I can't draw lines.</p>
            <p> Here's how it progressed.</p>
            <hr>
            <div class=row>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> So, there was a step before this where the whole picture
                        was scratched out in the smallest brush tool. I used a
                        500px by 500px canvas and drew guidelines, then drew features
                        on them in the same colour, erasing the guidelines as I went.
                        <p>I didn't save it, so this is the earliest save I have. I've gone
                        over the outline with the biggest brush and made it more even.
                        I have a bad chicken-scratch habit that I can't kick. I redrew
                        the right side of the face approximately 1 billion times.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> This is a mix of brushes 2 and 3. (There are 4). And
                        copious use of the eraser tool. </p>
                    <p> The eyes were uneven for a while;
                        I went back much later and evened them out a bit.
                        This took FOREVER. I discovered that drawing lines while zoomed
                        out results in wobbly line quality. This step probably took an hour. :(
                        When drawing in Paint, I start zoomed out to get the general shapes
                        (it's easier to see if things are uneven at a distance), then zoom in
                        for details.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-colour-1.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> Some colour experiments. You can see the old uneven eyes in these.</p>
                    <p> This one looked a bit odd when put in a round frame for the homepage.
                        Also my eyes aren't that colour. The shade looked a bit too saturated
                        for its surroundings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> Going back and adding eyebrows. I'd forgotten them. :)
                        The eyes are still uneven!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows-colour-2-eveneyes.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> Another colour experiment.</p>
                    <p> I'd evened the eyes by this point.
                        My eyes arguably aren't this colour either. :)
                        (Originally, I was aiming for hazel, but I liked the goofy flame effect caused
                        by doing it wrong).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows-colour-2-eveneyes-cropped.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> I tried cropping it. It looked weird.</p>
                    <p> Maybe I'll use this as an avatar.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p> Here's how the coloured version looked on the homepage:</p>

                <img src="img/frontpage.PNG" height="500" class="img-responsive">
                <p> It looked a bit too busy for the homepage, and odd in the round frame,
                    so I recoloured it to match (at a glance, anyway; the
                    gradient means that it doesn't quite match). I'd include a screenshot...
                    but it's the homepage! Go there to look! :)</p>
                <p> I often use a simple, flat monochrome colouring technique in paint.
                    I draw suggestions of the hair, but don't isolate it from the background.
                    Then I fill the hair.
                    Next, I fill the eyes in the same colour. Sometimes misc islands of white
                    are left over in interesting ways.</p>
            </div>
        <h4> Painting in Paint</h4>
        <p> Some examples</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-3">
                <img src="img/doodle-2-inverse-alt.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">

                <img src="img/doodle-3-alt-clean-lines-2-outline.png" class="img-responsive">
                <p> This was my old homepage image, but I was worried people would think
                   It was meant to be me. (It's just a random face. I like drawing them.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">
            <img src="img/I-should-be-asleep-thumbnail.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Drawing in black and then filling in black at the end is often effective.</p>

        <h4> Traditional Media</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> Although I'm passionately in love with MS Paint,
                    I'll always prefer traditional media</p>
                <p> With biros,
                    it's possible to get a much more gradated effect with minimal effort.
                    Pencils are similar,
                    although I try to avoid them,
                    as over the years,
                    pages drawn in pencil fade and rub away.</p>
                <p> I've kept drawing pads since I was 12;
                    I currently have two A3 ones in an attempt to learn to draw big
                    (and from the elbow)
                    and get better at lineart.</p>
                <p> I rarely colour; 
                    monochrome tends to look nicer to me.
                    When I do, I use pencil crayons,
                    or sometimes watercolour pencils.
                    I don't really know how to get the most out of them yet.
                    So I use them much like regular colours,
                    but that can be blended if rubbed.
                    The other reason I don't colour is that
                    my knowledge of colour theory is shaky.
                    But I have strong positive feelings
                    for burnt orange paired with turquoise
                    (or navy at a pinch).</p>
                <p> I don't have a scanner in my house at the moment.
                    I should change that.</p>

        <p> Portraits are my thing. And trying to draw 'realistically', even though pros
            find that boring. I like to obsess over the details.</p>
        <p> I used to feel bad that I only ever wanted to draw faces,
            and try to force myself to draw other things.
            I've now stopped caring. I'll draw what I like.</p>
        <p> I'd like to be good at landscapes but I am absymal.</p>
        <p> And I paint like a five year old,
            as 12-year-old me did not resolve to paint every day,
            and had the natural artistic skill of a five year old.</p>

            <p> I'm working through Loomis' 'drawing the head and hands' at the
                moment. At some point,
                I'll upload some of my attempts at the plates,
                with commentary.</p>
