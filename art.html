        <h1>Drawings and Things</h1>
        <p> I draw sometimes.
            I normally use some combination of biros,
            pencil crayons,
            MS Paint
            and the occasional pencil.</p>
            <p>I love MS Paint dearly
            and consider it the epitome of perfection.</p>
            <p>So! I thought these pages would be a handy place to put a gallery of sorts,
               and also in-progress things with explanations of how I made them,
               that sort of thing.
               It might be interesting to folks who want to achieve similar effects
               (if those people exist!), or who want to avoid making the same mistakes.
               It's also a roundup of my thoughts,
               which are boring,
               but I don't see why I should be the only one who has to suffer them.</p>
            <p> I'm an amateur.
                Drawing interests me because I'm naturally very bad at it,
                and can't picture objects or images in my mind at all.
                When I was 12,
                I got so fed up with being so bad at it
                that I grabbed every 'how to draw manga' book I could get my hands on,
                and I made myself draw every day.
                I kept that up,
                more or less,
                for some years.
                So, part of the reason I've put this up is because it's evidence that it's possible
                to improve, and that's something 12 year old me would have found reassuring
                to stumble across on the internet.</p>
            <p> I've always regarded it as an experiment,
                with myself as the subject--
                what standard can a human with no innate ability reach in a field?</p>
