        <h1>Drawings and Things</h1>
        <p> I draw sometimes.
            I normally use some combination of biros,
            pencil crayons,
            MS Paint
            and the occasional pencil.</p>
            <p>I love MS Paint dearly
            and consider it the epitome of perfection.</p>
            <p>So! I thought this page would be a handy place to put a gallery of sorts,
               and also in-progress things with explanations of my process,
               that sort of thing.
               It might be interesting to folks who want to achieve similar effects
               (if those people exist!).
               It's also a roundup of my thoughts,
               which are boring,
               but I don't see why I should be the only one who has to suffer them.</p>
            <p> I'm an amateur.
                Drawing interests me because I'm naturally very bad at it,
                and can't picture objects or images in my mind at all.
                When I was 12,
                I got so fed up with being so bad at it,
                that I grabbed every 'how to draw manga' book I could get my hands on,
                and I made myself draw every day.
                I kept that up,
                more or less,
                for some years.</p>
            <p> I've always regarded it as an experiment,
                with myself as the subject--
                what standard can a human with no innate ability reach in a field?</p>
            <h2> Projects</h2>
            <h4> This Website </h4>
            <p> This is the obvious place to start!</p>
            <p> I have a picture on the homepage. At time of writing, it looks like this:</p>
            <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows-colour-2-eveneyes-2-small.png" class="img-circle" width="200" height="200">
            <p> I <i>wanted</i> a two-second MS Paint doodle of me.</p>
            <p> I forgot that I can't draw lines.</p>
            <p> Here's how it progressed.</p>
            <hr>
            <div class=row>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> So, there was a step before this where the whole picture
                        was scratched out in the smallest brush tool. I used a
                        500px by 500px canvas and drew guidelines, then drew features
                        on them in the same colour, erasing the guidelines as I went.
                        <p>I didn't save it, so this is the earliest save I have. I've gone
                        over the outline with the biggest brush and made it more even.
                        I have a bad chicken-scratch habit that I can't kick. I redrew
                        the right side of the face approximately 1 billion times.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> This is a mix of brushes 2 and 3. (There are 4). And
                        copious use of the eraser tool. </p>
                    <p> The eyes were uneven for a while;
                        I went back much later and evened them out a bit.
                        This took FOREVER. I discovered that drawing lines while zoomed
                        out results in wobbly line quality. This step probably took an hour. :(
                        When drawing in Paint, I start zoomed out to get the general shapes
                        (it's easier to see if things are uneven at a distance), then zoom in
                        for details.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-colour-1.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> Some colour experiments. You can see the old uneven eyes in these.</p>
                    <p> This one looked a bit odd when put in a round frame for the homepage.
                        Also my eyes aren't that colour. The shade looked a bit too saturated
                        for its surroundings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> Going back and adding eyebrows. I'd forgotten them. :)
                        The eyes are still uneven!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows-colour-2-eveneyes.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> Another colour experiment.</p>
                    <p> I'd evened the eyes by this point.
                        My eyes arguably aren't this colour either. :)
                        (Originally, I was aiming for hazel, but I liked the goofy flame effect caused
                        by doing it wrong).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <img src="img/selfportrait-2-with-eyebrows-colour-2-eveneyes-cropped.png" width="200" height="200">
                    <p> I tried cropping it. It looked weird.</p>
                    <p> Maybe I'll use this as an avatar.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p> Here's how the coloured version looked on the homepage:</p>

                <img src="img/frontpage.PNG" height="500" class="img-responsive">
                <p> It looked a bit too busy for the homepage, and odd in the round frame,
                    so I recoloured it to match (at a glance, anyway; the
                    gradient means that it doesn't quite match). I'd include a screenshot...
                    but it's the homepage! Go there to look! :)</p>
                <p> I often use a simple, flat monochrome colouring technique in paint.
                    I draw suggestions of the hair, but don't isolate it from the background.
                    Then I fill the hair.
                    Next, I fill the eyes in the same colour. Sometimes misc islands of white
                    are left over in interesting ways.</p>
            </div>
        <h4> Painting in Paint</h4>
        <p> Some examples</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-3">
                <img src="img/doodle-2-inverse-alt.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">
                <img src="img/doodle-3.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">
                <img src="img/doodle-3-alt-clean-lines-2-outline.png" class="img-responsive">
                <p> This was my old homepage image, but I was worried people would think
                   It was meant to be me. (It's just a random face. I like drawing them.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">
            <img src="img/I-should-be-asleep-thumbnail.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Drawing in black and then filling in black at the end is often effective.</p>
        <br>

        <h4> Traditional Media</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> Although I'm passionately in love with MS Paint,
                    I'll always prefer traditional media.</p>
                <p> With biros,
                    it's possible to get a much more gradated effect with minimal effort.
                    (I will try to upload some clear examples in the future)
                    Pencils are similar,
                    although I try to avoid them,
                    as over the years,
                    pages drawn in pencil fade and rub away.</p>
                <p> I've kept drawing pads since I was 12 (just supermarket things);
                    I currently have two A3 pads in an attempt to learn to draw big
                    (and from the elbow)
                    and get better at lineart. So far,
                    I'm finding I just draw small pictures with a lot of space around them...</p>
                <p> I used to want to buy 'how to draw' books constantly;
                    I think I've got better at remembering adages about bad workmen and tools.
                    Perhaps others are familiar with that experience.</p>
                <p> I rarely colour; 
                    monochrome tends to look nicer to me.
                    That, and there's the omnipresent worry that I'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.
                    There's so much choice! And I always get it wrong!
                    But I have strong positive feelings
                    for burnt orange paired with turquoise
                    (or navy at a pinch).
                    When I dare, I use pencil crayons,
                    or sometimes watercolour pencils.
                    I don't really know how to get the most out of them yet.
                    So I use them much like regular colours,
                    but that can be blended if rubbed.
                </p>
                <p> I don't have a scanner in my house at the moment.
                    I should change that.</p>

                  After smudging the pupils,

            failure (and remember to take photos along the way)</p>
            
        <p> The most annoying thing is that there's no correlation between
            time-spent and quality-of-end-result. This Buffy doodle took 20 mins,

            find that boring. I like to obsess over the details.</p>
        <p> I used to feel bad that I only ever wanted to draw faces,
            and try to force myself to draw other things.
            I've now stopped caring. I'll draw what I like.</p>
        <p> I'd like to be good at landscapes but I am absymal.</p>
        <p> And I paint like a five year old,
            as 12-year-old me did not resolve to paint every day,
            and had the natural artistic skill of a five year old.</p>

        <h4> Krita</h4>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> This week (early Oct '16),
                    I tried out <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>,
                    which is free, open-source painting and drawing software.
                    This is dedicated painting and drawing software,
                    rather than photo-manipulation software with some painting and drawing
                    capability. It's designed for use with a tablet (it's pixel art, not
                    vector art, though there's
                    <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/lets-make-text-and-vectors-awesome-2016-kickstarter/">a kickstarter</a>
                    to improve the vector functionality).
                    I have a little experience of tools like this, but not lots
                    (aside from my beloved MS Paint, I've dabbled with Artweaver,
                    Photoshop CS2 and GIMP). I haven't painted with layers since
                    high school.
                    Here's how I got on!
                </p>
                <br>
                <b> First scribbles </b>
                <br>

                <p> Krita installed fine on Windows 7,
                and took about 10 seconds to start up the first time.
                I did experience lag (which was a 'noooooooo!' moment), but a Google around and
                it was easy to fix. I had to turn off OpenGL (in a checkbox at the top,
                after navigating to settings > configure Krita > Display). This was on by default;
                luckily it was the first thing I tried as I've had problems with OpenGL settings
                slowing down emulators in the past.
                This does make zooming slow and jerky; 
                the best workaround I've found is to wiggle the cursor around to update
                the page after zooming.
                To the right is my test doodle, where I tried out a bunch of brushes and things.</p>
                <p> I was excited; the UI was <i> lovely </i> and tools were easy to find. It
                    was quick to get started, the keyboard shortcuts were guessable,
                    and I didn't once click a menu or zoom accidentally when
                    trying to paint a line
                    (I find this happens far too often when using complex drawing software).</p>

                <b> Trying a Tutorial </b>
                <br>
                <p>After playing around a bit, I had a look for tutorials.
                <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/article185/tutorial-getting-started-with-krita-1-3-bw-portrait"> This one</a>
                looked ace, so I started there on my next lunchbreak.</p>
                <p> It's fair to say my first attempt... was an absolute disaster.</p>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/painting-in-krita-1.png">
                    <i> An hour of my life... </i>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                   <img class="img-responsive" src="img/painting-in-krita-1-shaky.png">
                <p><i> Here's a lower layer; you can see how shaky it is. Not good!</i></p>
                </div>
                <p> I'd set out to use a similar process to do a different type of picture,
                    but the styles didn't mesh well. I didn't shade subtly enough,
                    and I had some very shaky brush strokes, partly because I'd used a low-opacity
                    brush in the wrong place by accident, and then tried to fix it.
                    I think my mental state also plays a big role; I was tired and miserable
                    the day I tried this.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6">

                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <i> I often use a mirror when drawing so I can use my own face as reference
                        for light and shadow. There are pitfalls. On the left is my nose, shaded
                        to indicate light and shadow. On the right is the type of nose I see everywhere
                        else and thus draw by default. Good luck mapping the first to the second.
                        (This accounts for a good chunk of time spent erasing and redrawing the nose
                         on the picture below)</i>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> So, for my next attempt later in the week,
                    I tried making something closer to the style of the original,
                    and took more care over shading and using firm brush strokes.
                    This took much longer than the first attempt,
                    at around 5 hours, for the 'finished' thing (as you can see, it's not really finished;
                    I was just sick of it by that point and wanted to play the guitar):<p>
                <br>
                                                                                        
                <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/krita-painting-the-second-bigger-nose-2-crop.png">
                    <br>
                <i> Yeah, this is the point where I itch for traditional media. In pencil,
                    I could smudge this with my hand for about 10 seconds and blend all this
                    shading so it looked less clumsy. I haven't worked out how to use 
                    digital smudging tools effectively yet, so I just leave it.
                    This also makes me loath to use darker shadows, which in turn leads
                    to rather flat-looking images.</i>
                <p> Overall, I'm thrilled with how easy it was to make this,
                    and can't wait to try out some more brushes and things.
                    For someone who serious problems with skew, and has to flip images
                    constantly, the horizontal mirror tool is fantastic. I haven't gone
                    into much detail about *how* I made these, as I just followed the steps
                    in 
                    <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/article185/tutorial-getting-started-with-krita-1-3-bw-portrait">the tutorial
                    linked</a>.
                    The tutorial itself assumes a general knowledge of proportions and planes
                    of the face; it's a guide to using Krita rather than a guide to drawing itself.
                    That said, you could probably learn a lot about those things by closely observing
                    and copying the tutorial image. I didn't use a reference image,
                    but I've spent a ridiculous amount of time drawing facial features
                    over the years, so generic eyes, noses and mouths are burned into my brain.</p>
                    <p>I use an <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/intuos-pro-medium">Intuos Pro Medium</a>
                     that I bought a couple of years ago. It's been perfect and I feel I'm only
                    limited by my own ability (oh, and wacom have *beautiful* packaging;
                    the stylus is even stored in a faux inkwell,
                    the shape of which cannot be described,
                    only experienced).
                    They apparently have good Linux support,
                    though I haven't tested this much. Before my Intuos, I had
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trust-Graphics-Ultra-Thin-Ergonomic-Wireless/dp/B003MG11AM">
                    this</a>, which is completely different and didn't suit me.
