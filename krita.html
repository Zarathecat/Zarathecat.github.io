        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> This week (early Oct '16),
                    I tried out <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>,
                    which is free, open-source painting and drawing software.
                    This is dedicated painting and drawing software,
                    rather than photo-manipulation software with some painting and drawing
                    capability. It's designed for use with a tablet (it's pixel art, not
                    vector art, though there's
                    <a href="https://krita.org/en/item/lets-make-text-and-vectors-awesome-2016-kickstarter/">a kickstarter</a>
                    to improve the vector functionality).
                    I have a little experience of tools like this, but not lots
                    (aside from my beloved MS Paint, I've dabbled with Artweaver,
                    Photoshop CS2 and GIMP). I haven't painted with layers since
                    high school.
                    Here's how I got on!
                </p>
                <br>
                <b> First scribbles </b>
                <br>

                <p> Krita installed fine on Windows 7,
                and took about 10 seconds to start up the first time.
                I did experience lag (which was a 'noooooooo!' moment), but a Google around and
                it was easy to fix. I had to turn off OpenGL (in a checkbox at the top,
                after navigating to settings > configure Krita > Display). This was on by default;
                luckily it was the first thing I tried as I've had problems with OpenGL settings
                slowing down emulators in the past.
                This does make zooming slow and jerky; 
                the best workaround I've found is to wiggle the cursor around to update
                the page after zooming.
                To the right is my test doodle, where I tried out a bunch of brushes and things.</p>
                <p> I was excited; the UI was <i> lovely </i> and tools were easy to find. It
                    was quick to get started, the keyboard shortcuts were guessable,
                    and I didn't once click a menu or zoom accidentally when
                    trying to paint a line
                    (I find this happens far too often when using complex drawing software).</p>

                <b> Trying a Tutorial </b>
                <br>
                <p>After playing around a bit, I had a look for tutorials.
                <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/article185/tutorial-getting-started-with-krita-1-3-bw-portrait"> This one</a>
                looked ace, so I started there on my next lunchbreak.</p>
                <p> It's fair to say my first attempt... was an absolute disaster.</p>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/painting-in-krita-1.png">
                    <i> An hour of my life... </i>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                   <img class="img-responsive" src="img/painting-in-krita-1-shaky.png">
                <p><i> Here's a lower layer; you can see how shaky it is. Not good!</i></p>
                </div>
                <p> I'd set out to use a similar process to do a different type of picture,
                    but the styles didn't mesh well. I didn't shade subtly enough,
                    and I had some very shaky brush strokes, partly because I'd used a low-opacity
                    brush in the wrong place by accident, and then tried to fix it.
                    I think my mental state also played a big role; I was tired and miserable
                    the day I tried this.</p>

                        <i> I often use a mirror when drawing so I can use my own face as reference
                        for light and shadow. There are pitfalls. On the left is my nose, shaded
                        to indicate light and shadow. On the right is the type of nose I see everywhere
                        else and thus draw by default. Good luck mapping the first to the second.
                        (This accounts for a good chunk of time spent erasing and redrawing the nose
                         on the picture below)</i>

                <p> So, for my next attempt later in the week,
                    I tried making something closer to the style of the original,
                    and took more care over shading and using firm brush strokes.
                    This took much longer than the first attempt,
                    at around 5 hours, for the 'finished' thing (as you can see, it's not really finished;
                    I was just sick of it by that point and wanted to play the guitar):<p>
                <br>
                                                                                        
                <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/krita-painting-the-second-bigger-nose-2-crop.png">
                    <br>
                <i> Yeah, this is the point where I itch for traditional media. In pencil,
                    I could smudge this with my hand for about 10 seconds and blend all this
                    shading so it looked less clumsy. I haven't worked out how to use 
                    digital smudging tools effectively yet, so I just leave it.
                    This also makes me loath to use darker shadows, which in turn leads
                    to rather flat-looking images.</i>
                <p> Overall, I'm thrilled with how easy it was to make this,
                    and can't wait to try out some more brushes and things.
                    For someone who serious problems with skew, and has to flip images
                    constantly, the horizontal mirror tool is fantastic.
                    It's also comforting to realise that other people use it,
                    and I'm not uniquely bad at drawing symmetrically.</p>
                    <p>I haven't gone
                    into much detail about *how* I made these, as I just followed the steps
                    in 
                    <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/article185/tutorial-getting-started-with-krita-1-3-bw-portrait">the tutorial
                    linked</a>.
                    The tutorial itself assumes a general knowledge of proportions and planes
                    of the face; it's a guide to using Krita rather than a guide to drawing itself.
                    That said, you could probably learn a lot about those things by closely observing
                    and copying the tutorial image. I didn't use a reference image,
                    but I've spent a ridiculous amount of time drawing facial features
                    over the years, so the rules for generic
                    eyes, noses and mouths are burned into my brain.</p>
                    <p>I use an <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/intuos-pro-medium">Intuos Pro Medium</a>
                     that I bought a couple of years ago. It's been perfect and I feel I'm only
                    limited by my own ability (oh, and wacom have *beautiful* packaging;
                    the stylus is even stored in a faux inkwell,
                    the shape of which cannot be described,
                    only experienced).
                    They apparently have good Linux support,
                    though I haven't tested this much. Before my Intuos, I had
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trust-Graphics-Ultra-Thin-Ergonomic-Wireless/dp/B003MG11AM">
                    this</a>, which is completely different and didn't suit me.
</p>
                    <p> I've now had a quick go at colouring.
                        I don't know how to colour,
                        so I did the first few steps from
                        <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/article186/tutorial-getting-started-with-krita-2-3-colorize">the followup tutorial:</a>
                        . I didn't spend much time on it and stopped at step 4.
                        Here are the experiments so far:</p>

                        When I tried, I could only get red, orange, grey or green.

                <b>Krita as a sketching tool</b>
                <p> Over the winter holidays,
                I tested Krita as a paper sketchbook replacement,
                for sketching figures (5-10 mins per figure).
                I wanted some images for reference,
                so I wandered over to the online version of Vogue, clicked the
                <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/best-red-carpet-dresses-2016">first link I saw</a>
                and went from there.
                It took a bit of fiddling to get a setup where my screen was
                effectively split so I could see the full reference image and the full canvas
                simultaneously,
                but I got there in the end ('canvas only' didn't work in splitscreen,
                so I manually hid all the dockers). I used the ink_ballpen preset brush.
                </p>
                <p> With the tablet,
                it still takes me a long time to draw a line in the place I want it,
                so it doesn't yet *feel* like a pen and paper,
                but the end-results look pretty penlike.
