                                        and I have an understanding of OpenStack governance.

                                        I was previously responsible for announcing StoryBoard news,
                                        so have been interviewed in the OpenStack SuperUser magazine about it a couple
                                        of times (links on the right). I also set up the original
                                        <a href="https://storyboard-blog.io/">StoryBoard Blog</a> infra,
                                        though these days it's hosted on SotK's server, where it's much happier.
                                        StoryBoard is continuously delivered,
                                        so I am meticulous about testing and reviewing patches,
                                        to ensure that the infrastructure production instance always functions as expected.

                                      I use it frequently
                                      for code review, and have written scripts that use the API.
                                      (One reason I'm so fond of Gerrit is that the python gerritlib 
                                      API made it easy to do this
                                      back when I knew almost no python)
                                      I've helped test the OpenStack infrastructure staging
                                      instance in the past. I'm currently learning how gerrit's NoteDB
                                      uses git notes to record review information in git
                                      repositories, to help develop a Python NoteDB API.

                                      I like python, as it pushes people to write code that is easy
                                      to understand; communication matters to me. There are also libraries
                                      for <b>everything</b>.
