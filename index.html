                                        to ensure that the infrastructure production instance always functions as expected.</p>

                                      (One reason I love Gerrit so much is that the API makes it simple to do this)

                                      I like python, as it pushes people to write code that is easy
                                      to understand; communication matters to me.
                                      <br>
                                      I'm learning python in more depth at the moment,
                                      so that I can feel more comfortable with the libraries,
                                      and classes and object-oriented design more generally;
                                      you can follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com/Zarathecat">Github</a>.</p>

                                                and of course OpenStack's Horizon! I have used
                                                Virtmanager heavily, and the others quite a bit.
                                                I've even battled my way through a labyrinth of
                                                menus to get Virtualbox set up on Windows 10 (the
