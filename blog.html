                <h1>Blog!</h1>
                <p> This is the start of a blog!</p>
                <p> It's a collection of ramblings about software and other interests.
                    It mainly serves as a space for me to hash out thoughts in more depth than on IRC.</p>
                <p> The content will be very disorganized;
                    the difficulty of organizing things nicely in raw html
                    is the whole reason blog frameworks exist.
                    But! This may well be offset by the fact that I'll probably never post anything.</p>
                <p> I'll put things in reverse-chronological
                    order. If this balloons in size, or distinct themes emerge, I'll spread the content
                    across several pages, so it's easier to navigate.</p>
                <p> I have an advanced, bespoke tagging system. It's called `ctrl+f`.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> I've started blogs in the past.
                            What tends to happen is that I make, say, an art blog,
                            post a few things,
                            and then go on a music kick for ages.
                            By the time I get back to art, 
                            the blog is ancient</p>
                        <p> So, this website is my attempt to avoid that sad fate,
                            by having sections for multiple interests.
                            There might be times when I only update the music
                            section, or the games section, and so-on.</p>
                        <p> At some point I'll revamp this so that it contains
                            proper tags and soforth... But I won't stress over
                            it until I have some actual content.</p>

                        <p><i>01.10.16</i></p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> This week, I had a traumatic encounter with bad
                            statistics, so I've been thinking a bit about ways in which
                            humans derive conclusions from data. I figured
                            I might as well share it.
                            So! Here are three ways that people perceive the relation
                            between correlation and causation. The first two are
                            likely familiar; the third might not be. I leave it
                            to the reader to decide which way of thinking is the most
                            accurate, which is the most pragmatic, etc: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1) Correlation = Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            It must be really big because it eats sharks!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a lot.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2) Correlation != Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            I wonder if the cat is big because it eats sharks,
                            or if it eats sharks 
                            because it's big enough to fit them in its cat mouth--
                            or some combination of these factors? We need 
                            more evidence to determine the relation!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a fair bit, generally in response to a
                            a claim that implies 1).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3) Causation = Correlation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Hm, when we say thing 1 'causes' thing 2,
                            we just mean that 
                            whenever we see thing 1, it is followed by thing 2.
                            We then invent a theory to explain this pairing.
                            We don't have any reason to assume that these things
                            will always be paired (it would beg the 
                            question to use the theory, as the theory is based on the 
                            assumption that the pairing will always occur).
                            For all we know, 
                            thing 1 and thing 2 have just always happened to coincide
                            due to random chance. In this case, thing 1 =the size of the 
                            cat; thing 2 = its diet.
                            Even if the cat's
                            size *always* correlates with its food, how do we prove that this
                            isn't just chance? Do we have any reason to suppose we
                            will never see a giant cat that eats only sparrows in the future?'</p>

                        <p>I see that less. That's a quick (and scribbly) sketch
                        of the problem of induction, as it relates to causation. 
                        You can question many explanations' premises 
                        in this way. If someone says : 'We think the reason x and y must 
                        always go together is that z', it's interesting to find out what 
                        'always go together' consists in. If they've spent 2 hours 
                        observing the behaviour of a cat and noted it only eats sharks, 
                        you might be inclined to ignore their theory pending more 
                        convincing evidence.</p>

                        <p>Where this gets fun is the question, 'What constitutes convincing 
                        evidence?'. What if large shark-eating cats have been observed 
                        since the dawn of human civilisation? They eat only sharks, they 
                        are always large, they have terrorized humans for sport since 
                        the dawn of time... It is known.</p>

                        <p>That seems more compelling (and scary!), but then-- how long has 
                        human civilisation been around, relative to the existence of the 
                        universe? (scientific answer: not very) Even something that 
                        humans have observed every day might not form a substantial body 
                        of evidence relative to the size of, well, everything.</p>

                        <p>You can have some real fun with this. Say you take 'laws of 
                        nature' to be explanatory theories of human observations. Sure, 
                        we've yet to make an observation that contradicts a law of 
                        nature-- but is that particularly significant? We haven't been 
                        around that long. And what about when we're observing something
                        that has been around for much longer than we have?</p>

                        <p>(Now, 'Laws of nature are explanatory theories of human 
                        observations' is a pretty big assumption to make. I'm just 
                        gesturing so I can give a short overview, but there's an ongoing 
                        debate about whether laws of nature depend on facts, or whether 
                        facts depend on laws of nature. I incline toward the first view, 
                        since I don't see how a human can establish the second. If you'd 
                        like to read a much stronger, more detailed argument and survey 
                        of the landscape, I recommend the works of Helen Beebee;
                        this is a good place to start: 
                        <a href="http://thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Contemporary/Readings/Beebee.pdf">
                        'The Non-Governing Conception of Laws of Nature'</a> .
                        The position mentioned above is generally known as 
                        the Humean view of laws of nature, although Hume himself did not 
                        advocate it (rather, people felt it fit with his philosophy).</p>

                        <p> In general, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
                        is the place to go for accurate overviews of philosophical topics.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/">David Hume</a>
                        is famed for laying out the view of causation as 
                        correlation ('constant conjunction'). Section VII here is the 
                        most relevant bit: <a href="http://www.davidhume.org/texts/ehu.html">
                        'An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'</a>
                        . He's a clear writer, as 18th century philosophers go
                        (and clearer than many contemporary philosophers, unfortunately),
                        so enjoy!</p>
                        
                        <p> And that's that. If nothing else, I had fun writing that out.</p>

                        <p> People imply that writing skill has little overlap with coding skill,
                            but I doubt this; writing a program with understandable control flow
                            requires a similar process to
                            writing out a clear explanatory paragraph.
                            This is because clear code and clear writing require empathy for the reader.
                            I think it's just a question of <i>noticing</i> confusing things
                            -- and that comes with practice.
                            Here are some things I personally look out for in my technical docs.
                        </p>
                        <p> I'll skip the obvious things
                            ("don't waffle",
                            "use terms most readers can understand")
                            in favour of two things that are slightly less obvious,
                            so that I'm not repeating advice you can find everywhere else on the internet.</p>
                        <p> It's still not groundbreaking.
                            But maybe it's useful to somebody!
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> First thing:
                            ordering information.</p>
                        <p> Written documents can be disorganised
                            in the same way that a program can be disorganised.
                            This is obvious when whole paragraphs leap around
                            (and most people can notice and fix that),
                            but there's also such a thing as a disorganised sentence.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate with an example,
                            here are two imaginary pieces of documentation:
                        <p> #1</p>
                            <blockquote> First, install foo. Next, do the thing.
                                         Now, do the other thing. Finally, do the last thing.</blockquote>
                        <p>#2</p>
                            <blockquote> Do the thing. Before you do the last thing, do this thing.
                                         Do the other thing.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> How many times have you been burned by something like the second example?
                            What if I rephrase it like this:</p>
                        <blockquote> Run the command. Before you do that, make sure you've set
                                     your environment variable 'x' to 'y'. Now, run the script
                                     baz.py. You will need foo installed for this to work.</blockquote>
                        <p>? I see this <i>all</i> the time. It's the written-word equivalent of spaghetti code.</p>
                        <p> Nobody sets out to write spaghetti code;
                            it happens when people add things as they go along
                            because it wasn't possible to plan.</p>                        
                        <p> I see lots of documentation like the latter example,
                            and I understand how it happens.
                            People write the steps down in the order that the steps come to mind,
                            and sometimes people write a later step
                            before remembering an earlier step.
                            Sometimes another person tacks an earlier step onto the end.</p>
                        <p> That's a normal way to start...
                            and it's much like doing the first sketch of a program
                            (or the flow-chart for a program),
                            before you remember extra things to add,
                            and neaten it up.
                            It's important to reorder things before publishing,
                            so that someone can read instructions in the order of execution*.</p>
                        <p> Writing in order also helps combat ambiguity.
                            In the second sentence of the second example, it's not obvious what 'last'
                            refers to. The previous instruction? Or the final step?
                            It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts those sentences in a sensible order.</p>
                        <p> I think people skip the 'tidy up the order' step
                            either because:
                            a) They don't notice it
                            or
                            b) Documentation is perceived as less important;
                               the bar is set so low that 
                               people are praised for writing any docs at all.
                               Therefore, people don't set time aside for polishing docs.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> Along with writing programs in a sensible order,
                            it's good practice to use meaningful variable names.
                            For example, if you have a function that builds a system,
                            call it 'build_system()', not 'moomoomoo()'.
                            That's common knowledge.
                            But there's a written-word equivalent,
                            that is under-used:
                            referring to a subject or object by name,
                            rather than pronoun.</p>
                        <p> This isn't always necessary,
                            but it matters when the sentence structure could cause ambiguity.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate, here's an example,
                           quoted from above:</p>
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts <i>those sentences</i> in a sensible order
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> In that example,
                            in place of the italicised text,
                            the writer could use 'them':
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts them in a sensible order</blockquote>
                            But that would be harder to skim.
                            A tired reader might think
                            'them' referred to 'subjects'.</p>
                        <p> If you constantly need to refer to things by name,
                            and your prose is getting dry,
                            it's a sign that you should reorder some sentences.
                            Much like how,
                            if a line of code is 500 characters long,
                            the answer isn't to shorten all the variable names to 1 letter,
                            but to split the line up into smaller functions.</p>
                        <p> Well, that's that. I've listed a couple of things that slow
                            readers down when they're trying to scan for important information,
                            that I personally try to avoid.
                            The first is always worth fixing.
                            The second is more of a 'be aware of this and use your judgement' case;
                            you can go too far with it and end up with 'legalese'
                            that's even harder to follow. So be careful!</p>
                        <p> Anyway, when writing technical documentation,
                            the world will thank you
                            if you assume your reader is an insomniac
                            who is operating on about 0.000001% of their potential brainpower
                            (this is me on any given day).</p>
                        <p> That way,
                            us insomniacs will still be able to follow it,
                            and the rest of the world will be able to follow it <i>easily</i>. :)</p>

                    <div class="panel panel-default padded"><p> *This is a reason that I prefer the humble 'for' loop
                            and if/else statements
                            to list comprehensions,
                            even though list comprehensions are more 'pythonic'.
                            The syntax for list comprehensions
                            means that my brain has to jump back and forth.</p>
                        <p> A 'for' loop with if/else goes:
                            <blockquote>for a thing, in this set of things,
                                if x is the case,
                                    do y.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> You can easily lay that out as a series of questions,
                            progressing with each 'yes' answer
                            (and abandoning with any 'no'):</p>
                        <p> 'Here's a thing-- is it in this set? Yes! Is x the case? Yes! Okay, do y.'</p>
                        <p> The list comprehension equivalent is:
                            <blockquote>do y,
                                            for a thing, in this set of things,
                                                if x is the case.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> The questions layout doesn't work here.
                            I find the order hard to keep track of.</p>
                        <p> Maybe this order is preferable when trying to see why something did 'y',
                            and it's designed around debugging.</p>
                        <p> It feels like the reverse of the
                            order in which the instructions are evaluated and executed.
                            And it's the reverse of the order I would interpret an instruction.
                            The criteria that need to be satisfied
                            feel like bracketed afterthoughts,
                            but computers tend not to go,
                            'Okay,
                            I'll run this command
                            and then I'll see if
                            the if statement evaluates to True or False'
                            (and if your computer <i>does</i> behave like this,
                            take it back to the shop).</p>
                            <p>For a more natural languagey example, compare:
                            <blockquote> For each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric,
                                         go inside the shop</blockquote>
                            to
                            <blockquote> Go inside the shop,
                                         for each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> I suppose my ideal would be:
                        <blockquote> On this street,
