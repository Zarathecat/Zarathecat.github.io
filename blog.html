                <h1>Blog!</h1>
                <p> This is the start of a blog!</p>
                <p> It's a collection of ramblings about software and other interests.
                    It mainly serves as a space for me to hash out thoughts in more depth than on IRC.</p>
                <p> The content will be very disorganized;
                    the difficulty of organizing things nicely in raw html
                    is the whole reason blog frameworks exist.
                    But! This may well be offset by the fact that I'll probably never post anything.</p>
                <p> I'll put things in reverse-chronological
                    order. If this balloons in size, or distinct themes emerge, I'll spread the content
                    across several pages, so it's easier to navigate.</p>
                <p> I have an advanced, bespoke tagging system. It's called `ctrl+f`.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p> I've started blogs in the past.
                            What tends to happen is that I make, say, an art blog,
                            post a few things,
                            and then go on a music kick for ages.
                            By the time I get back to art, 
                            the blog is ancient</p>
                        <p> So, this website is my attempt to avoid that sad fate,
                            by having sections for multiple interests.
                            There might be times when I only update the music
                            section, or the games section, and so-on.</p>
                        <p> At some point I'll revamp this so that it contains
                            proper tags and soforth... But I won't stress over
                            it until I have some actual content.</p>

                        <br>

<p>This was originally titled 'learning the violin', but I think
that's too generous.</p>

<p>We have a violin lying around in our house. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/DSC03786.JPG"></p>

<p>It's my partner's; it's purple and glittery because that fit
best with his ambition
to play a violin on a windswept moor in the moonlight.
He took
lessons for about 6 months before abandoning that ambition
in favour of a Steam sale, and
I'd never played it myself. It was only a couple of weeks
ago, three years later, that I remembered the violin existed. </p>

<p>I picked it up and had a play around;
 I was curious and the unique awfulness of a
 violin appealed to my little troll heart.  
Plus I feel like if you have fancy things, 
you should use them
or give them away, and since it wasn't mine to give away but
it was sitting there,
that meant I had to use it (okay, it's a cheap violin,
but if a *violin* isn't the definition of a 'fancy thing', I
don't know what is).</p>

<p>I started out thinking it'd just be funny to
get a recording of me failing to play it to show my friends.
Here's me the first day I picked it up, after about half an
hour or so:</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/170704-000-violin/s-eb0Oq"> First violin attempt </a></p>


<p>When I started, I was... scared of it. It was very loud and very
unpleasant, so I would play a note, get frightened by the sound I'd made, 
faint, and wake an hour later in a cold sweat. 
I couldn't bear to practice
bowing for more than 10 minutes at a time the first couple of 
days, because the sound was so upsetting. </p>

<p>BUT. It sounded SO bad that it felt like the violin was mocking me;
every sharp note was the instrument cackling, 'Hahaha, you 
can't play me!'. And then it became A CHALLENGE
and I had to DEFEAT THE VIOLIN, my FOE. I was not going to let
some purple sparkly violin be the King of *this* Iron Fist 
Tournament.</p>

<p>So I kept coming back to
it, because there had to be SOME WAY to get it to sound good,
and I just had to figure out THE SECRET. And maybe this time
I'd suddenly be able to play it, or maybe now, or maybe *now*, or...</p>

<p>... Well, that hasn't happened yet, but it is weirdly addictive. 
Here's a clip from a week later (probably about 2 hours' total
 practice time between the first one and this one,
though some of that was spent holding it like a guitar and
playing 'Seven Nation Army' on it pizzicato...^^';
I played it for maybe 10-30 minutes a day across a few days,
and spent the rest of the time googling 'how long does it take
to learn to play the violin' in the hopes that it would
magically make me better):</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/violin-1-week/s-7WgT4">Violin after a couple of hours</a></p>

<p>Then I didn't touch it for a week, because I felt guilty
about playing it at all. The main reason I play instruments 
is to make it easier to compose*, so it's a bit of a chore
anyway, and I generally hate
playing instruments if I think other people have to hear.
I especially hate playing instruments
if I know I'm making a horrible sound. So violin-in-a-flat
is not in my comfort zone. But! I wanted to DEFEAT THE VIOLIN,
and that would require me to actually practice on it...</p>

<p>So I ordered a practice mute online 
(if curious, it was
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Violins/Stentor-Music-Co-Ltd-Ultra-Rubber-Violin/B00D7I8BIU"> this one</a> ).
 It made
the violin sound 'wrong'**, but it was much easier to practice
without fear of it making such a loud harsh sound. I could
focus on bowing and intonation without wanting to rush through
pieces just to end the torture, and do more 'technical' practice
without worrying that I'd get an eviction
notice. Though given the following exchange with my partner, I might still get
kicked out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  <i>Me: Hey am I getting better am I am I?</i></p>
<p>  <i>Him: Well... er... I would definitely say you're getting more, erm, *confident* with it...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus I have my critics-- but I think the mute
made a massive difference; this was after 30 minutes' practice
 with the mute (though I took it off for the recording):</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/violin-after-mute/s-QOog2"> Violin post-mute</a></p>

<p>It's still unpleasant, but better than it was, I guess.</p>



<p>Other things that changed between the first and last violin
clip:</p>
<p>* I learned how to hold the bow more conventionally and less like
  a saw</p>
<p>* I tightened the bow</p>
<p>* I rosined the bow</p>

<p>And I also somehow broke the chin rest with my face.</p>

                <br>
                <p> ** I later tried recording a piece with and without the mute, so it was possible to hear the
                     difference. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/sets/violin-comparison-with-and-without-mute/s-iluaa">
                     Here </a> it is. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>  I've also found that even though I don't play that much (max 1hr a day), try to
                     play quietly, and generally use the mute,
                     my left ear always feels like it's full of cotton wool after practicing.
                     I really wasn't expecting that, though I can't handle loud volumes in general (I sometimes prefer using bad
                     headphones because my mp3 player can't go quiet enough for me with the better ones), so maybe it's not surprising.
                     I've started wearing an earplug in that ear while playing;
                     I didn't want to block out too much noise, and so have finally found a use for
                     the freebie earplugs I get on long haul flights.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                    <p> It's now a little under a month since I first picked up the violin; 
                        here's where I'm at:</p>

                        Twinkle Twinkle</a> </p>
                    <p> I am likely to stay on that kind of piece for a while. </p>
                    <p> In an attempt to convince myself I do sometimes make progress,
                        I also recorded some guitar practice, so here it is for contrast (it's much quieter):</p>

                        <p> Last week, I attended the first OpenStack PTG (project teams
                        gathering)! It was great! </p>

                        <p>Previously, we had one event every 6 months: the OpenStack
                        Summit. This was a big gathering, and it could take a day or two
                        just to make a personal schedule of sessions you wanted to attend.
                        The attendees were a mix of developers, managers, marketing and
                        sales staff,
                        recruiters, people-new-to-OpenStack-who-were-curious-about-it,
                        press, live bands, ice-cream trucks, etc</p>

                        <p> This meant things were *busy*. It was pretty common to run
                        around all over the venue trying to catch different sessions,
                        struggling to find people you wanted to talk to, or starting a
                        conversation only for it to be interrupted after 10 seconds by
                        someone else or a busy timetable.</p>

                        <p> Along with the summit, there were also quieter, 'midcycle'
                        events, organised by each project team. These were designed to
                        make progress on specific work items that required people on a
                        project to be in the same room. We did some of these for 
                        StoryBoard, and they were pretty successful; we planned out a
                        lot of development, sent a lot of patches, and most importantly,
                        ate a lot of cake and gummy sweets.</p>

                        <p> However, since these midcycle events were organised per-team, 
                        there were many different midcycles in different
                        countries, all with schedules that could conflict with each other
                        or with other unrelated events.
                        Therefore, it was difficult
                        to attend multiple midcycle events, and thus cross-project work
                        suffered.</p>

                        <p> Enter the PTG. This is a developer-oriented, cross-project
                        event, aimed at bringing all OpenStack developers into the
                        same venue for a week to focus on the technical issues. 
                        While non-developers can attend, 
                        in general they will only get value from it if they have enough
                        context to know why they specifically should
                        be there. In general, if you are not a developer, and you don't 
                        know if you should be there, you probably shouldn't (because
                        you'll be bored with nothing to do!). There is still 
                        <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/">the
                        OpenStack Summit</a>
                        every six months-- an event geared toward cross-project
                        communication, new-contributor onboarding, presenting new features,
                        business discussions, etc.</p>

                        <p> I felt I had much more productive conversations at the PTG
                        than I had at previous summits, as people could focus better, 
                        and were more relaxed. OpenStack is always theatrical,
                        but a focused audience meant that participants were less worried
                        about presenting material to satisfy multiple audiences,
                        and could just get on with work.</p>

                        <p>There wasn't a global schedule of sessions; project teams just
                        each took a room, and organised agenda items in a way that made
                        the most sense to them. In the infra room, for example, fungi
                        read out the items on the agenda at the start of the first day,
                        and then we split off into groups to discuss the things relevant
                        to us and work on them. Most of the room huddled round to talk about zuulv3 and
                        work on specific things that jeblair had listed. People came up to
                        me to ask me about StoryBoard things, and in the gaps I sat near
                        the Zuul team, since I'm interested in the project, even if I'm
                        not directly involved at the moment. Sadly, I didn't succeed in 
                        learning the codebase through osmosis, but it was nice seeing
                        people looking happy when it got just that little bit closer to ready. :)</p>

                        <p> The thing I enjoyed most, though, was being able to catch up
                        with people and have long, uninterrupted conversations. It was
                        great to actually get to know people instead of having a 30
                        second 'hey, how are you?' 'I'm good, how are you?' 'fine, gotta
                        go' in a hallway. The hours were much the same (roughly 9am-1am
                        for me), but the quality of interactions was much higher, and
                        it was possible to discuss technical details at length in a
                        relaxed environment. We
                        spent the time between 6pm and 1am quiet restuarants and bars with 
                        small groups of people, instead of at big vendor-sponsored
                        parties where it was too loud to talk. At these sorts of events,
                        hundreds of introverts pretend to be extroverts for a week,
                        then spend a few more weeks alone at home recovering from the
                        amount of social interaction. :) So, if an event makes it easy
                        for attendees to branch off into small groups when they start
                        feeling tired, those attendees are less likely to get burned out 
                        before the end 
                        of the week, and actually end up participating *more* overall.</p>

                        <p>This atmosphere was fantastic when
                        meeting new people and discussing collaborating on projects. 
                        When I'm choosing projects to use, a tool is more appealing when 
                        multiple parties are interested in developing it, and, in my experience, 
                        fledgling projects tend
                        not to attract contributors based on technology, but based on
                        the people involved. In other words, software is a collaborative endeavour,
                        and many people pick projects (and companies!) based on 
                        whom they like working 
                        with (especially as a project in its early stages may 
                        require contributions in its participants' free time; if
                        you're going to give up your evening, you want to have fun
                        doing it).</p>

                                Some Differences between Python and Perl
                            </a>
                        </h4>
                        <p><i>26.02.17</i></p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Recently, I was tasked with sketching out the groundwork
                        for translating a Perl library to a Python library in a 
                        week.
                        I didn't know any Perl
                        when I started, but I'm more
                        used to 'translate this codebase from language A to language B'
                        where I'm new to language A <i>and</i> language B,
                        so it was almost relaxing. :) At
                        least this time I had some Python!</p>

                        <p>Needless to say, I didn't get very far with it, but I learned
                        a lot, so this is a short post on some differences I've found betweeen
                        Python and Perl. I figured it might be useful to note these
                        things somewhere I can find them again. They are in no particular
                        order.</p>

                        <p>I am (obviously!) not an expert. Take this post with a grain of
                        salt.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>1. Typing</h4>

                        <p> My notes here are not in-depth. Python and perl handle types a bit
                        differently. When asked to operate on two variables with
                        different types, Perl automatically converts one of them to
                        match the other, performs the  operation, and then changes
                        the variable back to its original type.
                        So if you add an int to a string, eg:</p>

                        <p><code>"123"+1</code></p>

                        <p>Perl will convert "123" to 123, do 123 + 1 to get 124, and then
                        convert that back, for a result of "124".</p>

                        <p>In Python, if you do <code>"123" + 1</code>, you will get a TypeError
                        , as the types don't match. You could either do 
                        <code>"123" + "1"</code> for string concatenation ("1231") 
                        or <code>123+1</code> for
                        addition (124).</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>2. Variable Names</h4>

                        <p>You've probably seen this around: Perl likes special characters.
                        Variables in Perl are prefixed by special characters denoting
                        their types; <code>@</code> connotes an array, <code>$</code> 
                        connotes a scalar (single value- could be a number, could be a string),
                        etc. So:</p>

                        <p><code>@dogs</code></p>

                        <p>would be something like:</p>

                        <p><code>dogs = []</code></p>

                        <p>in Python,</p>

                        <p>and</p>

                        <p><code>$foo = 'foo'</code></p>

                        <p>might be </p>

                        <p><code>foo = 'foo'</code></p>

                        <p>And so on. In Perl,<code>&</code> in front of the variable name can be
                         used as
                        the syntax for calling a function, though there are multiple
                        ways to do this. There is one way to call a function in Python:
                        use brackets after the name of the function.<p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>3. Function Declaration</h4>

                        <p>Well, in Perl they're known as subroutines, not functions. So
                        that's handy to know when searching the internet.
                        You define them like:</p>

                        <pre>
sub foo { 
    foobarbaz
}</pre>

                        <p>Any parameters passed to the subroutine exist within it in a list
                        denoted with the <code>@_</code> 'array variable'. You can also see 
                        individual values from that array with the 'indexed scalars', eg:
                        <code>$_[0]</code> and <code>$_[1]</code>, 
                        which mean 'get first thing from list of
                        parameters' and 'get second thing from list of parameters'
                        respectively. Also, the list of parameters becomes an array
                        once referred to with <code>@</code> (we'll come back to the difference
                        between lists and arrays in Perl in a bit).</p>

                        <p>Perl also has a plain old <code>$_</code>, 
                         which is a default variable used by many things. 
                         There is also <code>$1</code>, which can be used to get the 
                         first thing matched in the most recently run regexp.</p>

                        <p>Anyway.</p>

                        <p>You could call a subroutine like:</p>

                        <p><code>&makesounds('quack', 'moo');</code></p>

                        <p>and that subroutine might be defined like:</p>

                        <pre>
sub makesounds {
    local(@listofsounds)
    @listofsounds = @_
    local($ducksound)
    $ducksound = $_[0]
}</pre>

                        <p>In python, the equivalent call would be:</p>

                        <p><code>make_sounds('quack', 'moo')</code></p>

                        <p>and the equivalent definition:</p>

                        <pre>
def make_sounds(sound_1, sound_2):
    list_of_sounds = [sound_1, sound_2]
    duck_sound = sound_1</pre>
                            

                        <p>you could do this in a lot of different ways, but that shows
                        how things are passed. 
                        (You wouldn't need the explicit `list_of_sounds` there, for a start)
                        In python, variables are scoped to
                        the function in which they are defined, by default, and
                        it's preferable to call things by name than by position passed.</p>

                        <p>Python functions always return None,
                        unless they they are explicitly told to return a value.
                        Perl subroutines always return a value,
                        which will be the last thing evaluated in the subroutine.</p>
                        <br>



                        <h4>4. Arrays and Lists</h4>

                        <p>Arrays and lists are not the same thing in Perl, even though
                        these names are used interchangeably for other languages (and
                        are frequently used interchangeably in info about Perl, for some
                        reason). Perl's arrays are like python's lists. Perl's lists are
                        more like python's tuples (eg: lists are immutable). 
                        There are some differences,
                        but that's my mental model of them at the moment. Square brackets
                        denote arrays; curved brackets denote lists. There are better
                        guides to these elsewhere on the internet. The guide I visited
                        the most was:

                        <br>


                        <h4>5. Perl has a library called Mouse that has nothing to do with
                           the mouse</h4>

                        <p>This library extends perl's object-oriented programming (OOP)
                        support to make it easier to 
                        assign attributes to classes and things. Many features covered by
                        Mouse are builtin in Python. As you can see, I'm still sketchy on
                        the details. </p>

                        <p>Classes themselves are Perl packages;
                        they list methods (subroutines), including an object constructor
                        method, to make an instance of the class. The constructor can
                        have any name you want. 
                        If you name the constructor method 'new', then to create
                        an instance of the class, you could do:<p>


                        <p><code>$new_class_instance = ClassName -> new();</code></p>

                        <p>The class(/package) 
                        name is passed as the first argument to any methods in the class.<p>

                        <p>In Python, a class is just a class, and the constructor is always
                        the
                        <code>__init__</code> method; to create an instance of the class, you do:</p>

                        <p><code>new_class_instance = ClassName()</code></p>

                        <p>In Python, the class will be passed to
                        any of the class's methods that take 'self' as a parameter. This
                        must be explicit in the definition of the method, but does
                        not need to be listed when the method is called. So this:</p>

<pre>
class Foo:

    def __init__(self, param):
        self.name = param

    def test(self):
        print self.name

Foo('foo').test()</pre>

                        <p>will happily print 'foo', as it creates an instance of the Foo class
                        and then runs that instance's 'test' method. You don't need to
                        explicitly pass it 'self' in the call, or call <code>__init__()</code> by name.</p>

                        <p>A misc note that doesn't fit in anywhere else nicely:
                        in Python, you can have an array of arrays. 
                        In Perl, arrays are always 1D; you would not have an array of
                        arrays, but instead an array of references [to arrays].</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>6. Asserts</h4>

                        <p>Perl doesn't have asserts built in. Instead, it uses the <code>TestMore</code>
                        library, specifically the function <code>ok()</code>. Sometimes <code>is()</code> is used
                        instead, which is synonymous. So this also shouldn't be confused
                        with the python <code>is</code>, which is roughly a test for equality 
                        (to be precise, <code>is</code> in python checks that two variables point to
                         the same object; <code>==</code> checks that both variables pointed to are 
                        equal. These are referred to as 'reference equality' and 'value
                        equality' respectively, and catch me out about once a week.).</p>

                        <p>Misc note #2:
                        for Perl code, the <code>Carp</code> library is used for various 
                        exception-handling things;
                        <code>croak</code>, <code>confess</code> and <code>cluck</code> 
                        are all part of this library, 
                        so that's what's going on if you see those in some code.
                        Python code tends to include `try... except` blocks for this sort of thing.</p>
                        <br>
                            
                        <h4>7. String concatenation</h4>

                        <p>Perl uses the dot operator, eg:</p>

                        <p><code>'foo' . 'bar'</code></p>

                        <p>would be 'foobar'</p>

                        <p>python uses the +:</p>

                        <p><code>'foo' + 'bar'</code></p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>8. Ranges</h4>

                        <p>In Python, a range is indicated with the range function, which 
                        starts at the first argument and counts up to (but not including)
                        the second (with a third argument as an optional 'step').
                        To get the numbers 1 to 5, you would do:</p>

                        <p><code>range(1, 6)</code></p>

                        and to get every odd number from 1 to 10, you would do:

                        <p><code>range(1, 11, 2)</code></p> 

                        <p>(ie: that starts at 1, stops before it reaches 11, 
                        and goes up in steps of 2)</p>


                        <p>in Perl, the two dot operator is used. It is inclusive; to
                        print out numbers 1 to 5, you would do:</p>

                        <p><code>my @numbers = (1 .. 5);</code></p>

                        <p>there is no 'step' option. You would have to combine the two dot operator
                        with other things.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>9. Do Nothing</h4>

                        <p>In Python, to indicate unimplemented code that should be skipped
                        over, you use the pass keyword:</p>

                        <pre>
def foo():
    pass
                        </pre>

                        <p>in Perl, you would use a triple dot:</p>

                        <pre>
sub foo {
    ...
}
                        </pre>


                        <p>Both the two dot and triple dot operators have a couple of other
                        uses; see <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2014/01/dots-perl/">
                        perlhacks</a> for more (and for more details on the ones I've mentioned).</p>

                        <h4>10. There's More Than One Way To Do Things</h4>

                        <p>If you call a method from a class in Python, the order you write
                        things is fixed
                        and you need to include the brackets. In Perl, things are more
                        fluid. For example, something like:</p>

                        <p><code>Animals.list_animal()</code> in Python</p>

                        <p>could become</p>

                        <p><code>Animals -> list_animal();</code> in Perl</p>
                        <p> BUT </p>
                        <p><code>list_animal Animals</code> is an alternative that should work the same way.</p>
                        <p>This is known as indirect object invocation. It gets interesting when
                        you are calling methods with multiple parameters and soforth.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4> 11. Whitespace </h4>
                        <p> In Python, whitespace is syntactically significant. In Perl, it isn't.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p> Well, those are the ones I've hit so far that I feel I understand well enough
                        to write about in <i>some</i> capacity. If there are errors, feel free to email
                        me; I'm not an expert and I don't pretend to be! Hopefully this is still
                        useful to someone, even if that someone is just future-me.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                <p>So, last weekend, I built a PC with my partner. We'd been ordering
                parts over the last month, and finally it was time! This post
                is just a collection of thoughts about how it went for us.
                If you want a 'how to build a PC' post,
                there are lots of others online, written by people
                more knowledgeable than I am. (This post isn't even a useful
                collection of links, since we didn't go to any particular website
                and just searched things as we went along.)</p>

                <p>I've wanted to build my own PC since I was a teenager. I
                didn't do it in those days because it cost money,
                I had no internet access, 
                and  all my liquid assets were in the form of HMV tokens. Then I
                moved out and lived at a different address every year
                for half a decade, and my laptop covered my needs.
                I game a little, but my games tend to be about twenty
                years old-- a remnant of only buying preowned games as a kid.
                So, owning a desktop didn't make much sense.</p>

                <p>But! I work in software now. I'm thus picking up dangerous habits,
                such as making software.</p>

                <p>My home laptop is a Lenovo B570e, with
                an i3 processor, windows 7 Home Premium and 4GB of RAM.
                I adore it (it's a machine that historically has done what I need
                it to do and nothing else),
                but as I started spinning up more virtual machines to try things out, I'd
                get frustrated by the loading times. As well as virtual machines,
                there were some tools I was curious about (hi there unreal engine);
                my laptop would see the minimum requirements for them and laugh.
                More and more, I wanted to be able to send a quick
                patch for StoryBoard without waiting 15mins for a VM to wake up.
                I wanted to play pythonpython in real time...</p>

                <p>I decided I needed better hardware.</p>

                <p>My partner wanted to play newer games and had also wanted to
                build a PC for a while, so we agreed to split the cost down
                the middle and go for it. This was probably
                stupid because neither of us had built a PC before; I'd used
                an antistatic mat once at work and we'd made some LEDs light
                up via an arduino one time. So, hardware experts, right there.</p>

                <p>Buuuut we also knew we'd wonder
                'what if' if we did a practice build with parts we didn't care about,
                and probably end up spending more overall, so we decided to just do it.</p>

                <p>We used pcpartpicker to pick stuff out, based roughly on my
                partner's
                friend's recent build. The most fun part of this was seeing what kind
                of wacky things were out there. We discovered one vendor had made
                a computer case shaped like a train, that could move down a little track:</p>

                <br>
                <p>There were also some fantastically garish peripherals:</p>

                <p>In true bikeshed fashion, the bit that
                took the longest to pick was the keyboard. I tried asking
                an esteemed colleague what he'd gone for, only to discover
                he'd bought one that retailed for 190 quid. I decided that the keys must be made of
                gold bullion, he was a bad role model, and I should ignore him.</p>

                <p>In the end, the pressure was too much. My partner and I gave up and got 
                some Logitech business keyboard for about a tenner.</p>

                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Once we had all our parts, it was time to build the computer!
                We didn't know what we were doing, but figured
                it looked fairly easy. Our past victories included two ikea
                tables, a chest of drawers and a massive wardrobe, so... 
                exactly the same thing!</p>

                <p>Putting the pieces together was straightforward,
                though
                I had a heart-stopping moment where I thought I'd destroyed the
                motherboard by screwing in the cooler too tight, despite
                trying to be as careful as possible because I was scared I'd
                overtighten it! Protip:
                when the cooler manual depicts a screwdriver, you'd better finger-tighten,
                just as you were doing before you saw the screwdriver in the
                manual and thought it was important to tighten more than
                expected, with a screwdriver... (This was a Cooler Master Hyper
                and a Gigabyte z170x Gaming 7, if anyone's curious)</p>

                <p>Anyway, I was pretty heartbroken (I'd been so scared of overtightening
                that I'd only *nudged* the screws with the screwdriver
                and I have no physical strength *anyway*,; it was so unfair!).
                I feared that if we kept going and it
                *was* damaged, we'd short everything and lose all our
                material wealth.
                On the other hand, the motherboard wasn't cheap enough to just toss away,
                and we'd *finally* got all the parts, plus it was a Saturday night
                so there was no chance of getting next-day delivery for a
                replacement, so it'd be another week before we'd have time to
                try again. Such a dilemma...</p>

                <p>We stopped, took the cooler off, and took a look
                at the damage. It turned out to be far less than it seemed; I'd
                pulled up some of the transparent motherboard coating, but the
                traces seemed to be intact and things were only cosmetically scuffed.
                So we carried on, and I was relieved to have not burned around
                150 pounds. (Though only time will tell for sure...:( )</p>

                <p>Based on general trends we noticed in guides around the internet,
                we did things in the order: cpu-motherboard, cooler-motherboard,
                ram-motherboard, motherboard-case, PSU-case, cables, wifi card,
                video card . This worked. My partner's friend was impressed
                when we mentioned we'd assembled things with the case standing
                up, but that's a lot easier when there are two of you-- though
                building it standing did mean we nearly knocked it off the table
                a few times, so that was scary.</p>

                <p>The cooler was by far the trickiest bit to assemble and attach.
                It took us a while to notice that the instructions for multiple
                different types of boards were all lumped together on the page,
                and that not all the parts were relevant to us, 
                as they supplied parts for lots of different boards so you could
                just use the ones that matched yours.</p>


                <p>Also, at first we didn't realise the cooler screws could be repositioned
                to fit our board (I spent an embarrassingly long time going 'if
                only these screws could go into the middle of this space, then
                they'd fit' before I realised that they *could* go into the
                middle if I moved them the correct way. This was a cooler master
                hyper with a gigabyte z170x gaming 7, for reference, in case it
                would be useful to anyone to end up here through a search...
                There is a picture in the manual for this, but we missed it,
                and the manual also contains a picture of a screwdriver, so.).</p>

                <p>Most of the rest was just 'plug thing A into slot B', where the
                components only fit in the place they were meant to live. An encouraging
                thing I've picked up from work is that, when people say 'this
                is nice hardware', half the time they just mean 'it has
                labels and I am able to tell what things are' (I think this is
                often true of programming languages, for that matter).</p>

                <p>Both our case
                (corsair 450D; we didn't get the train)
                and components were well-labelled, and on the whole the
                cable labels matched up with the motherboard labels, so that made
                life easier. I think one of the cable labels said 'sw' where the
                motherboard expected 'ps', for 'power switch', or something
                like that, but the manuals made it possible to work out what was going on.
                It also took me a little while to work out that there were two
                rows for pins on the front panel bit of the motherboard, and the cover for them
                used one side to indicate things on the top row and the other side
                for things on the bottom row; at first I was confused the sides
                of the cover were different. I don't know how to express
                this any more clearly without pointing, and I'm too lazy to take pictures,
                sorry. Also I didn't know what it was called at the time and just
                looked at the manual now to discover it's referred to as the 'front panel',
                which makes sense since those connections are for things on the front panel
                of the case...</p>

                <p>Once we
                had most components hooked up (though not the graphics card,
                just in case my motherboard damage was worse than we thought
                and it fried things), we
                tried plugging in the monitor and seeing if it could boot to bios.
                It was the moment of truth...</p>

                <p>It booted!</p>

                <p>Things seemed sensible. Well, the BIOS were ridiculous in that
                they had *bevelled edges* and a *cursor* with a *gradient*
                 (I'm used to a more 70s look), but everything worked.
                The RAM reported was the amount we
                thought we'd put in. The temperature seemed comfortable. The
                processor's specs matched those on the box. We were kinda amazed
                that there was an LED in the case that showed numbers
                (apparently they're error codes...) and a backlit power symbol.
                We were living in the future.</p>

                <p>After we'd had enough time to bask in our newfound
                status as People Who Could Build A Computer And Were Basically
                Like The Smartest People Ever And Did You See That It 
                Turned On And Everything, 
                we turned the computer off, and added the graphics card. We had to move
                the wifi card since we'd put that in the middle for some reason
                (maybe, just maybe not the smartest people ever?),
                and there wasn't room, but it was pretty quick to fix.</p>

                <p>After that, we installed the various drives.  Working out how
                to take off the cover for the optical drive was time-consuming,
                probably because by this point it was about midnight and I
                had been ready to fall asleep when we started at 7pm. We
                eventually realised we needed to reach into the drive from within
                the case and push some tabs in to free it, so it was simple enough,
                just took a while to look in the right place.</p>

                <p> It also
                took us a while to locate the SSD bay (I'm still not convinced
                it didn't spontaneously appear on the back of the case when
                we needed it).</p>

                <p> Once we'd attached all
                our drives, and the remaining cables (the sata cables were
                fiddly), we tidied things up and checked it still worked.
                The computer booted again! And now, the graphics card glowed, too!
                Which was good because there was a dragon on it, and it's really
                important for you to have a tiny glowing LED dragon. It
                actually
                makes the computer run faster, because the computer doesn't
                want to look weak in front of the dragon. There are journals about it.*</p>

                <p>After
                we'd put the case sides back on, we noticed the back fan wasn't
                working. My partner wanted to fix it right then, but it was 1am
                and I overruled him with 'you are tired and you will end up
                knocking the computer off the table; we do this tomorow'.
                So we stopped for the evening.</p>

                <p>The next day, we showed OUR GLORIOUS NEW COMPUTER to his friend who was
                visiting. We turned it on, and at first there was no display,
                which filled us with dread.
                We eventually realised we'd actually received two VGA cables with
                our PSU, one of which had more pins to connect than the other
                (we thought they were both the same so didn't question having
                a spare port on the graphics card to plug something in, assuming
                that was for a different make of cable. Told you we were experts).
                So, if you get an EVGA fully modular power supply,
                be aware that the VGA cables might
                be different to each other.<p>
                <p>
                We swapped out the VGA-PSU cable and tried again (funnn, since it plugged
                into the PSU
                at the bottom at the back of the case); this time we
                got a picture.
                Finally, we fulfiled my partner's dream of sorting out the back fan, and
                THE DEVICE WAS COMPLETE.</p>

                <p>Later that day I installed the first OS, but I'll save that for
                a separate post, because this one's far too long already.</p>

                <p>So! Building a computer is really fun, and straightforward!
                If you have no idea what you're doing, you can
                learn just before you do stuff and you'll be okay!
                It's easier than many things! Check the manuals sometimes!
                There's a lot of light puzzle solving! People will say it takes
                2 hours; those people have probably done some of it before
                or spent more time reading up on the details first! 
                It probably took us about
                6 hours, working slowly and carefully and going back and checking
                things a lot, including reattaching the cooler! 
                Be careful with that cooler! It's yet another
                thing that's easier than developing in angularjs!</p>

                <p>I love being in a position where I have
                 the freedom to do this sort of thing, and I'm also glad to live 
                with someone who likes to do things
                like build a computer with me. There was a pretty even balance of
                'you're doing it wrong; it should be like this' from both of us,
                so we were both pleased about that, and he was kind
                about the potential motherboard disaster.
                (In terms of relationship-building,
                'building a computer' maybe doesn't rank <i>as</i> highly as
                 'going to dinner with another couple
                to remind you of all the reasons why your partner is so much better',
                but you get a computer out of it, which beats an awkward evening.)</p>

                <p>So, that's that! You should probably do it more sensibly than we did it,
                but building a PC is definitely worth it if you
                want something with good hardware; you probably don't save that much
                money (because you end up spending more getting better parts than
                you really need, and every time you try to look into finding a cheaper
                part, you instead end up upgrading to one that costs
                twice as much as your old choice...), but you get better value for money.
                You learn a lot, and it makes you feel less afraid to replace
                components in the future for fear of breaking everything,
                as you put them in there in the first place. And, most importantly,
                you get to say that you built your own PC!</p>

                        <p>
                        Yesterday I was chatting about maths things, and mentioned
                        offhand that people who are better at geometery than I am
                        tend to also outrank me at picturing objects in their minds.
                        My mathsy colleague (hi, SotK!) 
                        talked about being able to picture things
                        like a little
                        house that he could rotate, zoom in on, stand next to, walk around;
                         he could add some trees and a pond to the back garden.</p>
                         
                        <p>My responses were mainly incredulity and allcaps 
                        'BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT
                        IS IN VIEW AND WHAT IS OUT OF VIEW', even though I've met plenty
                        of other people who can do this. It always makes me feel like
                        I'm one of the last survivors of a different species,
                        away from which these people have evolved.
                        So here is a very long post on my experience; writing it out
                        helps me think more clearly about it, and I figure it should be
                        public since I love coming
                        across other people's and seeing how radically different they are.
                        If you're not interested in a long essay on what it's like to be
                        a Zara, this is not the place for you (but why are you on my blog?
                        It is a really boring blog! You will be <i>so</i> much happier
                        elsewhere! Be free, be free!)</p>

                        <p>So. I am awful at visualising things, to the point where I'm not sure
                        if I can at <i>all</i>. If someone says 'imagine an ice cream cone', I
                        am aware of a wavy-edged white thing of a certain size, 
                        that I know is Mr. Whippy shaped (instead of, say, round) but
                        couldn't actually draw if prompted because I don't know what
                        its precise shape is (well, that's not quite true. I could
                        draw it but I'd be working out its shape based on what I already
                        had on the page). I picture its colours, and
                        I picture a crisscross raised (I feel it) texture that I know 
                        is on the cone,
                         but don't actually 'see' on the cone (again, if I tried to draw
                        it, I wouldn't know where exactly it was). If I try to picture
                        it on the cone, I get a completely different angle, 
                        and the edges are a mystery.
                         I get a lot of background sound; I hear someone biting
                        it and can imagine the movements of little crumbs falling off,
                        from another perspective entirely. I know the ice cream
                        is on top of the cone but I can't picture the place the ice cream
                        and cone
                        intersect; when I try, I picture a flash of an empty ice cream
                        cone instead, from a different angle, and I'm not sure what
                        that looks like really (I get a circle with spokes, but I don't think
                        I'm imagining it consistently from one perspective all the way
                         round, so it's more a collection of partial circles with spokes, 
                        as that's what I 'know' it looks like).</p>

                        <p>So yeah, my impressions of all the 'components' of the ice
                        cream are from different perspectives and distances, 
                        in different positions,
                        and very very vague anyway. The best way I can describe it is
                        when you are shown a flash of video for a fraction of a second
                         and then try to recall it, 
                        and there's just a distorted, vague after-image. 
                        Though it's possible other people's experience of
                        *that* phenomenom differs from mine, so that might not be
                        helpful at all. And also it's after-images of multiple videos,
                         shifting and dissolving into each other
                        and never being clear to begin with.
                        They're being drawn in invisible ink,
                        so the only bit I'm aware of is the motion of drawing;
                        it can feel like
                        there is an image going on *somewhere*, but I can't see it.
                        And it's more like an after-image of experience than
                        an after-image of video since other senses are squooshed in there. I
                        get a bunch of disparate, weak data, some realistic, some
                        cartoonish, including a summery light
                        quality and a sense of the 'icecreamness' of the icecream,
                        some wave sounds, some kids yelling, vague sea smell, vague
                        ice cream smell, 
                        vague ice cream cone smell, feel of ice cream cone in hand, 
                        a wasp's sound and movement, impressions of
                        all sorts of other things related to ice creams, etc...</p>


                        <p>I *can* picture colours, and their distribution, and 
                        (probably the same thing? )
                        light quality. I can picture textures,
                        sort of (I think I'm getting a mix of colours, sensation to the touch
                        and how light hits a thing). I have a sense of where things are
                        in 3d space; if I close my eyes, there's a left, a right, an up,
                        a down, and things can be nearer or further from me. I just can't
                        picture the things themselves. I can only picture very basic
                        shapes 'as' movements; if I think of a vase, I actually think of
                        a single point moving in the way it would move were I to draw the
                        side of a vase, and I 'feel' it in my hand. 
                        I could tell you what the vase was made of and picture its texture, 
                        just not its
                        shape (at least, not all at once). In that vein, I can tell if a line
                        is wavy or straight, but not precisely where it ends and begins
                        (at the same time, anyway), and it's more like I 'know' it's
                        wavy and can trace over the waves than that I 'see' the waves. I
                        'feel' volumes; I don't see them.</p>

                        <p>Visualising other senses is fine. I can imagine sounds easily,
                        along with textures, smells and (more weakly) tastes. I think
                        I do a lot of it without noticing when I imagine visual things. 
                        When I imagine something, my body simulates its response; 
                        when I picture a smell, I feel it in my
                        nose, which scrunches if it's a bad smell, and taste it in
                        my mouth
                        (if it's a bad smell my throat might close and my stomach might tense up).
                        Similarly, if I picture a sound moving around behind my head, I feel 
                        it move (though I actually seem to track it with my eyes and
                        cheeks/jaw, and
                        when I asked my partner, he found he also used his eyes. Weird.). </p>

                        <p>When you look at objects in real life, you move your eyes a lot
                        without noticing, to perceive the whole object; in general only
                        a tiny fraction is in focus at any moment. (eg: read a sentence,
                        feel your eyes move; try to work out how many words you actually
                        *see* at a time. 
                        I get about three letters in focus and a blur of everything else in
                        my field of vision, then quickly move my eyes to see more,
                        normally without noticing). I feel like my mental images are kind of
                        like that, only I can't move from one image to the next to
                        construct a bigger shape, because the blurred background gets replaced
                        with nothingness, and there's no way to focus in on nothing. 
                        My colleague and
                        I joked
                        that I'm missing a module 
                        and need to install some graphics capabilities in my brain;
                        maybe my head's overzealous about back-face culling. I
                        do see things in dreams, that look like real things, so that
                        might suggest it's not a storage problem, but a problem with recall. 
                        (And yes, this whole post is just description and vague speculation; 
                        I'm too lazy to do any
                        real philosophy on it right now, so best not reading it as such.)</p>

                        <p>So, when I try
                        to picture something visual, it's like my eyes try to find it,
                        but can't tell where to focus, and each time they *change* focus,
                        I lose the whole picture and get a different one. So I can
                        picture a single point, and I can picture it moving from one
                        place to another, but I can't picture the line between the
                        starting point and the ending point, as I lose the starting point
                        when I change focus. My partner says he doesn't move his eyes or
                        focus with his eyes at all when picturing visual things; 'they
                        come from the back of my mind on a screen'. BUT WHERE IS THAT.</p>


                        <p>We also discovered that I find it easier to imagine things if
                        my eyes are open; then I can picture a basic line or shape
                        extending off something in my field of vision, or resting on
                        top of something else, etc. My partner finds it easier to imagine
                        things with his eyes closed, 
                        as it feels like a totally different process
                        to seeing things with his eyes. I quizzed him a bit on what
                        happens with basic shapes, and we had this exchange:</p>

                        <blockquote>Me: I can picture the number '3', but it's more like I picture a
                            point of light tracing out the shape of the 3, that leaves
                            a brief afterimage, and I feel it in my hand</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Him: I think mine is showing off now because I'm picturing a 3D
                             '3' rotating</blockquote>

                        <p>WHAT. HOW. YOUR BRAIN CAN'T JUST *DO* THAT. THAT'S SOME X-FILES
                        NONSENSE.</p>

                        <p>So yeah, I'm not sure I can picture any still shape.
                         I think I can only picture movements, colours and proportions.
                         I can also
                        picture light; I sometimes give myself headaches by picturing
                        bright light, and feel the muscles around my eyes tense 
                        (once you've remembered you can do it it's really
                        hard not to do it...). Well, not sure if I see it or just
                        simulate my response to it, but it feels the same...</p>

                        <p>My partner can't picture smells at all. I think that's pretty common,
                        but seems strange to me since smells seem so much simpler than
                        pictures. It feels like there's less data to get confused by, with smells.</p>

                        <p>I've seen several blogposts on 'aphantasia': a lack of inner
                        visual imagery-- but that doesn't quite fit for me. It's more like
                        I have a texturing, positioning and animation studio, 
                        and someone just left out the drawing bit. 
                        Given a bunch of components, I can arrange
                        them in space, colour them in and move them around-- 
                        I just can't
                        make or see the components themselves. 
                        It makes no sense but that's what
                        my brain does, and it's possible that 'location in space' or
                        'movement' is not visual data to me but more simulated physical movement. 
                        But I don't see what else light and colour could be,
                        so I figure I've got some visual imagination going on. I also
                        wonder whether it correlates with eye-quality at all;
                        I'm so shortsighted that things start to blur 5in from my face.</p>

                        <p>I always thought it'd be cool to be able to visualise objects,
                        since then drawing from imagination would be like drawing from
                        observation, and I could create fantasy worlds.
                        But maybe my brain does other cool stuff to compensate, 
                        that I can't identify because I'm the one experiencing it.
                        A lot of people seem to find it harder to make up melodies than I do;
                        I could just tell myself my box swapped a beetle for
                        a Beatle. (I'm sorry, nobody deserved that...) But yeah,
                        everyone else gets a sci-fi superpower; I want one, too.
                        Please let me know if you notice it.</p>

                        <p>This whole thing also reminds me of being a kid and trying
                        to run fast with my head rather than my legs. I'd try to speed
                        up by tensing my body up. I don't think I realised
                        I could move my legs 'without thinking about them' instead until 
                        I was in my mid-teens. It felt like the roadrunner animation!
                        So maybe I'm capable of picturing objects,
                        and I've just spent my whole life doing it wrong. That'd be pretty
                        funny.</p>
                        
                        <p>This also means I intend to write some pygame-dev-helpers for
                        displaying the coordinates of objects in space, etc, for poor
                        souls like me, who can only picture a complete object by literally drawing
                        it. I'm considering basing something on
                        <a href="https://github.com/Zarathecat/badpaint">badpaint</a>
                        for it. Need to give it some thought, and find out what exists
                        already. I just know I'm wasting
                        a lot of time working similar geometry out repeatedly,
                        and hey, my maths teacher always
                        said the best mathematician is a lazy mathematician. :)</p>

                        <br>
                        <p> I planned to do a bunch of stuff this holiday.
                            I was going to pick up where I left off on
                            <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>
                            (day 10, I think)
                            and save Xmas from the malevolvent Easter Bunny.
                            I was going to send some patches to
                            <a href="https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/page/about">StoryBoard</a>.
                            I was going to get the 
                            <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
                            out of the drawer
                            and make it do something festive.
                            I was going to write some games, get more familiar
                            with <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>,
                            learn some C++, finally move on from plate
                            29 in 
                            <i><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1421684.Drawing_the_Head_and_Hands">'Drawing the Head and Hands'</a></i>,
                            rewrite the novel,
                            make progress with the keyboard and the classical guitar,
                            decorate, maybe finish some embroidery...</p>
                        <p> Then I bought Rocksmith.</p>
                        <p> And that's the story of how I forsook my former life for the electric guitar.</p>
                        
                        <p> For the uninitiated: it's like guitar hero,
                            but you use an actual guitar.
                            People asked me some questions about whether it was good for learning the
                            guitar, so I thought I'd summarize my experience here.</p>
                        <p> First, some context, since this kind of thing will totally
                            depend on your prior experience.
                            
                        <p> On the gaming side,
                            I love rhythm games and played dancing stage and guitar
                            hero to death. (A longer list is more like: Dancing Stage, 
                            Parappa the Rapper, Dance: UK,
                            Stepmania, Amplitude, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Patapon, Audiosurf,
                            Vib Ribbon, Space Channel 5... rhythm games are probably my fave genre,
                            so I've played a lot of obscure ones over the years.)
                            That side of things is very familiar to me, and I'm good at them through
                            repetition if nothing else.</p>
                            
                        <p> On the 'actually playing a guitar' side,
                            I've been learning the guitar for
                            a couple of years. I have two.
                            My first is a classical, the Valencia 3100A.
                            This was about 60GBP off Amazon; that is an AWFUL way to buy
                            guitars and you should never do it,
                            but I was lucky and mine sounds nice.
                            Although it might even be a fake 
                            (online pictures of the 'same' guitar
                            look different to mine)...
                        </p>
                        <p> My second is an electric <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/Products/SG/G-400-PRO.aspx">Epiphone G400 Pro</a>
                            that I bought for my birthday after a year,
                            once I was sure I wouldn't just drop the hobby; at that point
                            I thought I could spend more and get something that'd age well. ALSO, IT'S SHINY.</p>
                        <p>
                            Before starting, I was able to read music,
                            and had been learning to play the keyboard for about 6 months.
                            I can't play any other instruments.
                            My brain seems to lean heavily toward music,
                            but I have no awareness of my own body and it
                            takes me forever to learn movements.
                            So it takes me a decade or two to learn a bar,
                            and my playing is often indistinguishable from someone repeatedly dropping the instrument on the floor.</p>
                        <p> 
                            I'm probably best classed somewhere from 'experienced beginner' to 'early intermediate'.
                            I've been learning the two styles of guitar at the same time;
                            'pop' guitar via the <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a>
                            series, and 'classical' guitar
                            mainly via <a href="http://jasonwaldron-guitarist.com.au/classical_guitar_manual.html">this book</a>.
                            For a year I learned both styles on the same guitar.
                            (It's an interesting experience;
                            it feels a lot like playing two different instruments that happen
                            to be shaped the same way, and the notes and chords 'feel' different.)
                            A classical guitar has a much wider neck and more spaced out frets,
                            so my flimsy justification for buying the shiny electric was that I'd be able
                            to do things like power chords without crying, along with
                            things I couldn't do on a classical, such as sustains and string bending...
                            </p>
                        <p> What actually happened is that I much preferred the harp-like sound of the
                            classical and just ended up playing on that most of the time.
                            When I did play the electric,
                            the metal strings sounded 'wrong',
                            and
                            I'd get frustrated at my relative lack of dexterity
                            with the pick. So I'd switch to using my fingers, and wouldn't learn much
                            specific to the electric.
                            </p>
                            
                        <p> Enter Rocksmith!</p>
                        <p> I think the biggest benefit of this game is that it takes you out of your comfort zone.
                            I quickly found it didn't register things very well if I used my fingers,
                            so I had no choice but to switch to the pick.
                            I discovered that,
                            judging from how far my picking hand was from the right string,
                            my picking hand thought the right string was in a different room.
                            Well, pride destroyed, but I can see (and hear) the accuracy improving from day to day.
                            You could argue that if I'm not going to pick,
                            I don't need to learn it,
                            but I'd like to have the option of playing fast things on the electric if I want to,
                            and I prefer the tone anyway (fingers sound a bit muddy when strumming).</p>
                        <p> In a similar vein, it makes you play music/styles that you otherwise wouldn't play.
                            There's very little on the tracklist I've even listened to before,
                            let alone wanted to play. That could be frustrating if you wanted the game
                            to teach you specific songs (though there is (pricey) DLC),
                            but I was more interested in building technical ability
                            and getting more familiar with my electric so I could
                            go off and learn whatever I wanted.
                            So, along the way, I'm learning techniques that I wouldn't otherwise look at
                            (for any length of time, anyway), and I think that makes my playing more rounded.
                            At the moment I'm just powering through songs to scrape enough points
                            to unlock things, so I'm not really trying to
                            learn any songs, but I'm still finding I'm memorizing things
                            and can play a bunch of new riffs from memory. And hey,
                            I've found some new bands to listen to.</p>
                        <p> Another nice part is that the game rewards you for hitting streaks of notes,
                            but you get extra points for using the relevant techniques.
                            So this is a pretty effective way for practicing stuff like palm-muting and slides,
                            without penalizing you if you get the right notes and just miss the technique.
                            There are also some great minigames;
                            'ducks' (hit ducks by fretting the right note)
                            is good for getting comfortable
                            jumping around the whole neck of the guitar;
                            until now I've mainly been playing in
                            first position, so this has been great for things from the 5th fret.
                            A version including note names would be even better for subconscious memorization,
                            but working out the note names at the start and then singing them each time they
                            come up will work in its absence.
                            There's also a zombie shooter in which you have to hit chords as fast as possible,
                            which is pretty good practice.</p>
                        <p> Even with experience of a billion rhythm games,
                            it takes a while to get the hang of reading the notes on screen;
                            I'm still not totally comfortable with it. The yellow and orange look similar
                            (A and G string respectively), so I get them mixed up sometimes.
                            Similar things happen with the '3' and '5' (for 3rd and 5th fret).
                            It's hard to see the 'shape' of upcoming
                            music, so you might play through something a few times with awkward fingering before
                            realising it's just an arpeggiated D7 or something like that.
                            When I started, I was confused because all the notes seemed to be 'upside down'
                            and I couldn't explain what was 'upside down' about them or why I felt so disoriented by it.
                            It turns out the strings are displayed (by default) as the inverse of tab,
                            so the low E string is at the top.
                            You can fix this and flip them back in Game Settings,
                            and I'm forever indebted to whomever argued for that feature.
                            I can see the argument that some beginners may find it easier,
                            but it will make things more difficult for them later when they want to play tab
                            (and also traditional notation, since higher notes are higher on the stave).
                            (And add my voice to the chorus asking for an option for horizontal scrolling tab.)</p>
                        <p> A fun side-effect to learning 'pop' guitar for a couple of years first is that I
                            started with chords. So while my picking is clumsy and inaccurate,
                            having done almost no 'lead' practice,
                            I'm pretty comfortable changing between basic chords fast.
                            The game treats chords as more difficult than single notes,
                            so it introduces them after you hit a high enough percentage of single notes
                            in a song.
                            So, because of the order in which I learned things, 
                            this is like unlocking 'easy' mode after battling through 'hard' mode,
                            so that's fun (thanks, Justin guitar!)! It was a bit of a relief the first time,
                            since I was starting to wonder whether I'd hallucinated being able to play
                            the guitar a bit...</p> 
                            
                        <p> The 'dynamic difficulty' (game gives you more notes to play when you do stuff right)
                            does mean that you're learning multiple
                            different songs per song,
                            since the best fingering for a note depends on
                            what else you're playing around it,
                            and that changes.
                            It feels better not to 
                            build up too much muscle-memory until you're playing the hardest version of a song
                            so you don't learn the wrong thing.
                            So I find I don't worry about using the most efficient fingering
                            until I'm playing the hardest version of a song,
                            because that feels pointless, or even counter-productive.
                            This does mean you can end up playing something differently each time,
                            which won't be the fastest way to progress,
                            and pick up bad habits.</p>
                        <p> Some people have experienced lag with this game. I haven't. I just have a HDMI
                            cable from an old PS3 into the TV. Maybe there's lag that I just haven't noticed.</p>
                        <p> The session mode in Rocksmith 2014 is ace for trying things out, learning
                            different scales, and learning how to make music instead of just
                            playing other people's. I like this because most of Rocksmith is very geared toward
                            building muscle-memory and hitting the right things at the right times,
                            whereas this is a lot more focused on *listening*.</p>
                        <p> On that note, though, there is a pretty fundamental drawback:
                            there is no 'replay' feature you can use to *listen* to yourself
                            after playing a song
                            and hear what you need to improve.
                            The game is a lot more accurate than I expected,
                            but it's no substitute for an ear,
                            so that omission is a shame.
                            I've heard it was left out because players found it demotivating,
                            but I feel that the choice to listen should be left up to the player.
                            Anyway, I have a mic, so I've just been recording on that,
                            and listening when I feel brave.</p>
                        <p> In general, I think the game is a great tool for increasing dexterity,
                            accuracy, learning some patterns and the basics of various techniques.
                            I think it would be a good resource for learning specific songs,
                            though I haven't done that yet, partly because the tracklist is
                            very geared toward fans of 1990s-2000s indie-grunge-garage,
                            and that's not where I live. I miss the diversity of styles of Guitar Hero
                            (and the diversity of avatars).
                            I love a mix including psychedelic, blues, new wave, glam, hair metal, progressive,
                            and downright weird.</p>
                        <p>
                            There's some more variety in DLC, but the business model means those tracks are
                            included based on projected sales, so they cater to existing requests rather than
                            introducing people to new things. All in all, I found classic guitar hero a better place
                            for new music suggestions. Which is fine, but also a reason I didn't buy Rocksmith until
                            it was on sale for 60% off.
                            The first game is also a bit weird in that everyone is male,
                            from the tutorial guy to the guitarist in the opening demo to most of the vocalists.
                            Rhythm games have been around a long time;
                            this kind of branding is relatively new to the genre, and,
                            since it coincides with mainstream acceptance of rhythm games as 'real' games
                            (in this country, at least),
                            a bit depressing.
                            But that's a whole other blogpost that I probably don't have the energy to write.
                            Not everyone is male in the intro video of the 2014
                            one, at least, so I guess someone pointed it out as weird.</p>
                        
                            <p>
                            Anyway, Rocksmith can help you to hit the right notes,
                            it can help you to hit notes at the right time,
                            and it can help you to hit the right notes at the right time.
                            It probably can't help you go from that to sounding *good*.
                            But it's a start. 
                            Plus it's motivated my partner to try learning the guitar again,
                            so maybe I'll get a jam buddy sometime. :)</p>

                        <p> This week, <a href="https://dmsimard.com/">David Moreau Simard (irc: dmsimard)</a>
                            was kind enough to
                            praise our work over the last few months on the UI and UX for StoryBoard!
                            <a href="http://sotk.co.uk/about/">Adam Coldrick (irc: SotK)</a> and I* especially enjoy compliments like these,
                            as StoryBoard has been our first foray into frontend development,
                            and we've had to figure out a lot as we've gone along.</p>
                            <p>The company where we work specialises in systems engineering,
                            so we've been very fortunate to gain experience in web-development via working on OpenStack.
                            We've had the opportunity to learn about the web-development
                            ecosystem from people such as <a href="https://krotscheck.net/">Michael Krotscheck </a>
                            (who has both taught us a lot and developed the bulk of StoryBoard before we were involved with the project),
                            and <a href="http://www.logicative.com/">Beth Elwell</a> (who sends UI patches to StoryBoard as a relaxation method!).</p> 
                        
                            <p>So, anyway, we got a compliment!
                               After I'd finished calling up everyone I knew,
                               and telling them to read irc RIGHT NOW,
                               I started wondering: how do we do stuff?
                                For UI and UX design,
                            can we offer any pointers to teams in the same position we were a year ago?</p>
                            <p>I'll probably do this as a series of posts, as and when I remember things. So!
                            Here's the first. I think it's the most important thing,
                            and we saved a lot of time by starting to work this way early on.</p>
                        <p><b>TIP: Dig to find out the actual problem</b></p>
                        <p> There is a fitting Neil Gaiman quote;
                             it's his fourth suggestion over here:</p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one/"><i>
                                "Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them,
                                they are almost always right. 
                                When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it,
                                they are almost always wrong"
                            </i></a></p>
                            <p> -- Neil Gaiman
                            </p>
                         <p> So, that's a quote about creative writing-- but we can generalise!
                             When users have an issue, they will suggest specific implementation changes.
                             When that happens, it's good to step back and establish what they're trying to do and
                             why. 
                             Identifying the root problem allows you to fix the same issue in all its guises,
                             instead of moving buttons around and back again as you try to satisfy contradictory
                             implementation suggestions.
                             Often, you'll find the best change is nothing like the original suggestion.</p>
                        <p>  You need to be active and engaged during this process;
                             it's obvious when people reply with questions for the sake of it, like this:</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  User: Argh, the 'create new task' button is on the left; all the other buttons live
                                   on the right; it's annoying; can it go on the left, too?</p>
                        <p>  Developer: So, what do you want to do when you click that button?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  Well, obviously they want to create a task. Like all development methodologies, don't
                             follow this one dogmatically in cases where it makes no sense. :) Similarly...</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  User: When I search for a tag, it doesn't show all things matching the tag I specify. It should do.</p>
                        <p>  Developer: Why do you want the software to return all things matching the tag, instead of just some?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  That's an extreme example, just to show that you shouldn't ask questions
                             without paying attention, trying to empathise with the user, and attempting
                             to make yourself familiar with the process they want to perform.
                             There *are* related questions that would make sense in that scenario, eg:</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  Developer: Okay, you want a list of everything that matches that tag. Out of interest, how do you then use that
                                        list?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  The user will say something unexpected,
                             and this will reveal a *lot* about how you should present the list.
                             For example, the user might want it laid out a certain way so it'll behave nicely
                             when pasted into some other service, in which case it might be better to
                             create an interface for other services (otherwise, the next user will want a different
                             layout, and the next, etc).
                             You might discover that your software can already solve their problem,
                             as it has this interface already,
                             and you need to draw more attention to the interface.
                             Or, the user might plan to do something with the list that your
                             software can't yet do, in which case you have an early heads-up for a bigger feature request.
</p>
                             <p>
                             So, at this point, you note the use-case; if it seems like a good thing to fix,
                             you plan to implement the fix. If not, you raise your reservations with the user;
                             sometimes one of you will change your mind, sometimes not. If you still don't feel convinced,
                             you put it on the backburner, and wait to see if
                             a chorus of other people raise the same issue-- in which case should also discuss the
                             reservations with them, see what they say, and revisit your assumptions as necessary.</p>
                        <p> You need to be careful with this process. Firstly, if you ask questions just to try to change
                        someone's mind, they will pick up on it and you won't have a productive discussion; you have to 
                        go in with an open mind and be humble about your opinions. Secondly, you should respect the user's
                        time; if the discussion takes too long,
                            the user can get frustrated and think 'other software does this
                            like x, so why can't this team just implement it like x?'. But that ignores the original motivation
                            *not* to use that other piece of software-- people wanted a better implementation,
                            not more of the same. </p>
                        <p>Well, that's that! Hopefully, this will help you feel less overwhelmed when lots of users have
                        different opinions, and you'll be able to discuss and change things more efficiently. Good luck!</p>

                        <p><i>01.10.16</i></p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> This week, I had a traumatic encounter with bad
                            statistics, so I've been thinking a bit about ways in which
                            humans derive conclusions from data. I figured
                            I might as well share it.
                            So! Here are three ways that people perceive the relation
                            between correlation and causation. The first two are
                            likely familiar; the third might not be. I leave it
                            to the reader to decide which way of thinking is the most
                            accurate, which is the most pragmatic, etc: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1) Correlation = Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            It must be really big because it eats sharks!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a lot.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2) Correlation != Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            I wonder if the cat is big because it eats sharks,
                            or if it eats sharks 
                            because it's big enough to fit them in its cat mouth--
                            or some combination of these factors? We need 
                            more evidence to determine the relation!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a fair bit, generally in response to a
                            a claim that implies 1).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3) Causation = Correlation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Hm, when we say thing 1 'causes' thing 2,
                            we just mean that 
                            whenever we see thing 1, thing 2 follows.
                            We then invent a theory to explain this pairing.
                            We don't have any reason to assume that these things
                            will always be paired (it would beg the 
                            question to use the theory, as the theory is based on the 
                            assumption that the pairing will always occur).
                            For all we know, 
                            thing 1 and thing 2 have just always happened to coincide
                            due to random chance. In this case, thing 1 =the size of the 
                            cat; thing 2 = its diet.
                            Even if the cat's
                            size *always* correlates with its food, how do we prove that this
                            isn't just chance? Do we have any reason to suppose we
                            will never see a giant cat that eats only sparrows in the future?'</p>

                        <p>I see that less. That's a quick (and scribbly) sketch
                        of the problem of induction, as it relates to causation. 
                        You can question many explanations' premises 
                        in this way. If someone says : 'We think the reason x and y must 
                        always go together is that z', it's interesting to find out what 
                        'always go together' consists in. If they've spent 2 hours 
                        observing the behaviour of a cat and noted it only eats sharks, 
                        you might be inclined to ignore their theory pending more 
                        convincing evidence.</p>

                        <p>Where this gets fun is the question, 'What constitutes convincing 
                        evidence?'. What if large shark-eating cats have been observed 
                        since the dawn of human civilisation? There are also small cats,
                        that have everything in common, except size and the fact that they never
                        eat sharks. The large cats eat only sharks, and cats that eat sharks are
                        always large. These cats have terrorized humans for sport for as long as 
                        humans have existed... It is known.</p>

                        <p>That seems more compelling (and scary!), but then-- how long has 
                        human civilisation been around, relative to the existence of the 
                        universe? (scientific answer: not very) Even something that 
                        humans have observed every day might not form a substantial body 
                        of evidence relative to the size of, well, everything.</p>

                        <p>You can have some real fun with this. Say you take 'laws of 
                        nature' to be explanatory theories of human observations. Sure, 
                        we've yet to make an observation that contradicts a law of 
                        nature-- but is that particularly significant? We haven't been 
                        around that long. And what about when we're observing something
                        that has been around for much longer than we have?</p>

                        <p>('Laws of nature are explanatory theories of human 
                        observations' is a pretty big assumption to make. I'm just 
                        gesturing so I can give a short overview, but there's an ongoing 
                        debate about whether laws of nature depend on facts, or whether 
                        facts depend on laws of nature. I incline toward the first view, 
                        since I don't see how a human can establish the second. If you'd 
                        like to read a much stronger, more detailed argument and survey 
                        of the landscape, I recommend the works of Helen Beebee;
                        this is a good place to start: 
                        <a href="http://thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Contemporary/Readings/Beebee.pdf">
                        'The Non-Governing Conception of Laws of Nature'</a> .
                        The position mentioned above is generally known as 
                        the Humean view of laws of nature, although Hume himself did not 
                        advocate it (rather, people felt it fit with his philosophy).</p>

                        <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/">David Hume</a>
                        is famed for laying out the view of causation as 
                        correlation ('constant conjunction'). Section VII here is the 
                        most relevant bit: <a href="http://www.davidhume.org/texts/ehu.html">
                        'An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'</a>

                        so enjoy!</p>
                        
                        <p> And that's that. If nothing else, I had fun writing that out.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> I haven't been coding for all that long,
                            but I've found that writing a program has a lot in common with writing, well, words.</p>
                        <p> People imply that writing skill has little overlap with coding skill,
                            but I doubt this; writing a program with understandable control flow
                            requires a similar process to
                            writing out a clear explanatory paragraph.
                            This is because clear code and clear writing require empathy for the reader.
                            I think it's just a question of <i>noticing</i> confusing things
                            -- and that comes with practice.
                            Here are some things I personally look out for in my technical docs.
                        </p>
                        <p> I'll skip the obvious things
                            ("don't waffle",
                            "use terms most readers can understand")
                            in favour of two things that are slightly less obvious,
                            so that I'm not repeating advice you can find everywhere else on the internet.</p>
                        <p> It's still not groundbreaking.
                            But maybe it's useful to somebody!
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> First thing:
                            ordering information.</p>
                        <p> Written documents can be disorganised
                            in the same way that a program can be disorganised.
                            This is obvious when whole paragraphs leap around
                            (and most people can notice and fix that),
                            but there's also such a thing as a disorganised sentence.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate with an example,
                            here are two imaginary pieces of documentation:
                        <p> #1</p>
                            <blockquote> First, install foo. Next, do the thing.
                                         Now, do the other thing. Finally, do the last thing.</blockquote>
                        <p>#2</p>
                            <blockquote> Do the thing. Before you do the last thing, do this thing.
                                         Do the other thing.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> How many times have you been burned by something like the second example?
                            What if I rephrase it like this:</p>
                        <blockquote> Run the command. Before you do that, make sure you've set
                                     your environment variable 'x' to 'y'. Now, run the script
                                     baz.py. You will need foo installed for this to work.</blockquote>
                        <p>? I see this <i>all</i> the time. It's the written-word equivalent of spaghetti code.</p>
                        <p> Nobody sets out to write spaghetti code;
                            it happens when people add things as they go along
                            because it wasn't possible to plan.</p>                        
                        <p> I see lots of documentation like the latter example,
                            and I understand how it happens.
                            People write the steps down in the order that the steps come to mind,
                            and sometimes people write a later step
                            before remembering an earlier step.
                            Sometimes another person tacks an earlier step onto the end.</p>
                        <p> That's a normal way to start...
                            and it's much like doing the first sketch of a program
                            (or the flow-chart for a program),
                            before you remember extra things to add,
                            and neaten it up.
                            It's important to reorder things before publishing,
                            so that someone can read instructions in the order of execution*.</p>
                        <p> Writing in order also helps combat ambiguity.
                            In the second sentence of the second example, it's not obvious what 'last'
                            refers to. The previous instruction? Or the final step?
                            It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts those sentences in a sensible order.</p>
                        <p> I think people skip the 'tidy up the order' step
                            either because:
                            a) They don't notice it
                            or
                            b) Documentation is perceived as less important;
                               the bar is set so low that 
                               people are praised for writing any docs at all.
                               Therefore, people don't set time aside for polishing docs.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> Along with writing programs in a sensible order,
                            it's good practice to use meaningful variable names.
                            For example, if you have a function that builds a system,
                            call it 'build_system()', not 'moomoomoo()'.
                            That's common knowledge.
                            But there's a written-word equivalent,
                            that is under-used:
                            referring to a subject or object by name,
                            rather than pronoun.</p>
                        <p> This isn't always necessary,
                            but it matters when the sentence structure could cause ambiguity.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate, here's an example,
                           quoted from above:</p>
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts <i>those sentences</i> in a sensible order
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> In that example,
                            in place of the italicised text,
                            the writer could use 'them':
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts them in a sensible order</blockquote>
                            But that would be harder to skim.
                            A tired reader might think
                            'them' referred to 'subjects'.</p>
                        <p> If you constantly need to refer to things by name,
                            and your prose is getting dry,
                            it's a sign that you should reorder some sentences.
                            Much like how,
                            if a line of code is 500 characters long,
                            the answer isn't to shorten all the variable names to 1 letter,
                            but to split the line up into smaller functions.</p>
                        <p> Well, that's that. I've listed a couple of things that slow
                            readers down when they're trying to scan for important information,
                            that I personally try to avoid.
                            The first is always worth fixing.
                            The second is more of a 'be aware of this and use your judgement' case;
                            you can go too far with it and end up with 'legalese'
                            that's even harder to follow. So be careful!</p>
                        <p> Anyway, when writing technical documentation,
                            the world will thank you
                            if you assume your reader is an insomniac
                            who is operating on about 0.000001% of their potential brainpower
                            (this is me on any given day).</p>
                        <p> That way,
                            us insomniacs will still be able to follow it,
                            and the rest of the world will be able to follow it <i>easily</i>. :)</p>

                    <div class="panel panel-default padded"><p> *This is a reason that I prefer the humble 'for' loop
                            and if/else statements
                            to list comprehensions,
                            even though list comprehensions are more 'pythonic'.
                            The syntax for list comprehensions
                            means that my brain has to jump back and forth.</p>
                        <p> A 'for' loop with if/else goes:
                            <blockquote>for a thing, in this set of things,
                                if x is the case,
                                    do y.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> You can easily lay that out as a series of questions,
                            progressing with each 'yes' answer
                            (and abandoning with any 'no'):</p>
                        <p> 'Here's a thing-- is it in this set? Yes! Is x the case? Yes! Okay, do y.'</p>
                        <p> The list comprehension equivalent is:
                            <blockquote>do y,
                                            for a thing, in this set of things,
                                                if x is the case.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> The questions layout doesn't work here.
                            I find the order hard to keep track of.</p>
                        <p> Maybe this order is preferable when trying to see why something did 'y',
                            and it's designed around debugging.</p>
                        <p> It feels like the reverse of the
                            order in which the instructions are evaluated and executed.
                            And it's the reverse of the order I would interpret an instruction.
                            The criteria that need to be satisfied
                            feel like bracketed afterthoughts,
                            but computers tend not to go,
                            'Okay,
                            I'll run this command
                            and then I'll see if
                            the if statement evaluates to True or False'
                            (and if your computer <i>does</i> behave like this,
                            take it back to the shop).</p>
                            <p>For a more natural languagey example, compare:
                            <blockquote> For each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric,
                                         go inside the shop</blockquote>
                            to
                            <blockquote> Go inside the shop,
                                         for each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> I suppose my ideal would be:
                        <blockquote> On this street,
                                     for each shop,
                                     if the shop stocks fabric,
                                     go inside the shop.</blockquote>
