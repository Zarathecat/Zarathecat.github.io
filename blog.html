                <h1>Blog!</h1>
                <p> This is the start of a blog!</p>
                <p> It's a collection of ramblings about software and other interests.
                    It mainly serves as a space for me to hash out thoughts in more depth than on IRC.</p>
                <p> The content will be very disorganized;
                    the difficulty of organizing things nicely in raw html
                    is the whole reason blog frameworks exist.
                    But! This may well be offset by the fact that I'll probably never post anything.</p>
                <p> I'll put things in reverse-chronological
                    order. If this balloons in size, or distinct themes emerge, I'll spread the content
                    across several pages, so it's easier to navigate.</p>
                <p> I have an advanced, bespoke tagging system. It's called `ctrl+f`.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> I've started blogs in the past.
                            What tends to happen is that I make, say, an art blog,
                            post a few things,
                            and then go on a music kick for ages.
                            By the time I get back to art, 
                            the blog is ancient</p>
                        <p> So, this website is my attempt to avoid that sad fate,
                            by having sections for multiple interests.
                            There might be times when I only update the music
                            section, or the games section, and so-on.</p>
                        <p> At some point I'll revamp this so that it contains
                            proper tags and soforth... But I won't stress over
                            it until I have some actual content.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> I planned to do a bunch of stuff this holiday.
                            I was going to pick up where I left off on
                            <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>
                            (day 10, I think)
                            and save Xmas from the malevolvent Easter Bunny.
                            I was going to send some patches to
                            <a href="https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/page/about">StoryBoard</a>.
                            I was going to get the 
                            <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
                            out of the drawer
                            and make it do something festive.
                            I was going to write some games, get more familiar
                            with <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>,
                            learn some C++, finally move on from plate
                            29 in 
                            <i><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1421684.Drawing_the_Head_and_Hands">'Drawing the Head and Hands'</a></i>,
                            rewrite the novel,
                            make progress with the keyboard and the classical guitar,
                            decorate, maybe finish some embroidery...</p>
                        <p> Then I bought Rocksmith.</p>
                        <p> And that's the story of how I forsook my former life for the electric guitar.</p>
                        
                        <p> For the uninitiated: it's like guitar hero,
                            but you use an actual guitar.
                            People asked me some questions about whether it was good for learning the
                            guitar, so I thought I'd summarize my experience here.</p>
                        <p> First, some context, since this kind of thing will totally
                            depend on your prior experience.
                            
                        <p> On the gaming side,
                            I love rhythm games and played dancing stage and guitar
                            hero to death. (A longer list is more like: Dancing Stage, 
                            Parappa the Rapper, Dance: UK,
                            Stepmania, Amplitude, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Patapon, Audiosurf,
                            Vib Ribbon, Space Channel 5... rhythm games are probably my fave genre,
                            so I've played a lot of obscure ones over the years.)
                            That side of things is very familiar to me, and I'm good at them through
                            repetition if nothing else.</p>
                            
                        <p> On the 'actually playing a guitar' side,
                            I've been learning the guitar for
                            a couple of years. I have two.
                            My first is a classical, the Valencia 3100A.
                            This was about 60GBP off Amazon; that is an AWFUL way to buy
                            guitars and you should never do it,
                            but I was lucky and mine sounds nice.
                            Although it might even be a fake 
                            (online pictures of the 'same' guitar
                            look different to mine)...
                        </p>
                        <p> My second is an electric <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/Products/SG/G-400-PRO.aspx">Epiphone G400 Pro</a>
                            that I bought for my birthday after a year,
                            once I was sure I wouldn't just drop the hobby; at that point
                            I thought I could spend more and get something that'd age well. ALSO, IT'S SHINY.</p>
                        <p>
                            Before starting, I was able to read music a bit,
                            and had been learning to play the keyboard for about 6 months.
                            I can't play any other instruments.
                            My brain seems to lean heavily toward music,
                            but I have pretty much no awareness of my own body and it
                            takes me a long time to learn movements.
                            So I learn to *play* things slowly,
                            and my playing is often indistinguishable from someone repeatedly dropping the instrument on the floor.</p>
                        <p> 
                            I'm probably best classed somewhere from 'experienced beginner' to 'early intermediate'.
                            I've been learning the two styles of guitar more-or-less simultaneously;
                            'pop' guitar via the <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a>
                            series, and 'classical' guitar
                            mainly via <a href="http://jasonwaldron-guitarist.com.au/classical_guitar_manual.html">this book</a>.
                            For a year I learned both styles on the same guitar.
                            (It's an interesting experience;
                            it feels a lot like playing two different instruments that happen
                            to be shaped the same way, and the notes and chords 'feel' different.)
                            A classical guitar has a much wider neck and more spaced out frets,
                            so my flimsy justification for buying the shiny electric was that I'd be able
                            to do things like power chords more easily, along with
                            things I couldn't do on a classical, such as sustains and string bending...
                            </p>
                        <p> What actually happened is that I much preferred the harp-like sound of the
                            classical and just ended up playing on that most of the time.
                            When I did play the electric,
                            the metal strings sounded 'wrong',
                            and
                            I'd get frustrated at my relative lack of dexterity
                            with the pick. So I'd switch to using my fingers, and wouldn't learn much
                            specific to the electric.
                            </p>
                            
                        <p> Enter Rocksmith!</p>
                        <p> I think the biggest benefit of this game is that it takes you out of your comfort zone.
                            I quickly found it didn't register things very well if I used my fingers,
                            so I had no choice but to switch to the pick.
                            I discovered that,
                            judging from how far my picking hand was from the right string,
                            my picking hand thought the right string was in a different room.
                            Well, pride destroyed, but I can see (and hear) the accuracy improving from day to day.
                            You could argue that if I'm not going to pick,
                            I don't need to learn it,
                            but I'd like to have the option of playing fast things on the electric if I want to,
                            and I prefer the tone anyway (fingers sound a bit muddy when strumming).</p>
                        <p> In a similar vein, it makes you play music/styles that you otherwise wouldn't play.
                            There's very little on the tracklist I've even listened to before,
                            let alone wanted to play. That could be frustrating if you wanted the game
                            to teach you specific songs (though there is (pricey) DLC),
                            but personally I was more interested in building technical ability
                            and getting more familiar with my electric so I could
                            go off and learn whatever I wanted.
                            So, along the way, I'm learning techniques that I probably wouldn't otherwise look at
                            (for any length of time, anyway), and I think that makes my playing more rounded.
                            At the moment I'm just powering through songs to scrape enough points
                            to unlock things, so I'm not really trying to
                            actually learn any songs, but I'm still finding I'm memorizing things
                            and can play a bunch of new riffs from memory. And hey,
                            I've found some new bands to listen to.</p>
                        <p> Another nice part is that the game rewards you for hitting streaks of notes,
                            but you get extra points for using the relevant techniques.
                            So this is a pretty effective way for practicing stuff like palm-muting and slides,
                            without penalizing you if you get the right notes and just miss the technique.
                            There are also some great minigames;
                            'ducks' (hit ducks by fretting the right note)
                            is good for getting comfortable
                            jumping around the whole neck of the guitar;
                            until now I've mainly been playing in
                            first position, so this has been really helpful for things from the 5th fret.
                            A version including note names would be even better for subconscious memorization,
                            but working out the note names at the start and then singing them each time they
                            come up will work in its absence.
                            There's also a zombie shooter in which you have to hit chords as fast as possible,
                            which is pretty good practice.</p>
                        <p> Even with experience of a billion rhythm games,
                            it takes a while to get the hang of reading the notes on screen;
                            I'm still not totally comfortable with it. The yellow and orange look pretty similar
                            (A and G string respectively), so I get them mixed up sometimes.
                            Similar things happen with the '3' and '5' (for 3rd and 5th fret).
                            It's hard to see the 'shape' of upcoming
                            music, so you might play through something a few times with awkward fingering before
                            realising it's just an arpeggiated D7 or something like that.
                            When I started, I was really confused because all the notes seemed to be 'upside down'
                            and I couldn't explain what was 'upside down' about them or why I felt so disoriented by it.
                            It turns out the strings are displayed (by default) as the inverse of tab,
                            so the low E string is at the top.
                            You can fix this and flip them back in Game Settings,
                            and I'm forever indebted to whomever argued for that feature.
                            I can see the argument that some beginners may find it easier,
                            but it will make things more difficult for them later when they want to play tab
                            (and also traditional notation, since higher notes are higher on the stave).
                            (And add my voice to the chorus asking for an option for horizontal scrolling tab.)</p>
                        <p> A fun side-effect to learning 'pop' guitar for a couple of years first is that I
                            started with chords. So while my picking is clumsy and inaccurate,
                            having done almost no 'lead' practice,
                            I'm pretty comfortable changing between basic chords fast.
                            The game treats chords as more difficult than single notes,
                            so it introduces them after you hit a high enough percentage of single notes
                            in a song.
                            So, because of the order in which I learned things, 
                            this is like unlocking 'easy' mode after battling through 'hard' mode,
                            so that's fun (thanks, Justin guitar!)! It was a bit of a relief the first time,
                            since I was starting to wonder whether I'd hallucinated being able to play
                            the guitar a bit...</p> 
                            
                        <p> The 'dynamic difficulty' (game gives you more notes to play when you do stuff right)
                            does mean that you're effectively learning multiple
                            different songs per song,
                            since the appropriate fingering for a note depends on
                            what else you're playing around it,
                            and that changes.
                            It feels better not to 
                            build up too much muscle-memory until you're playing the hardest version of a song
                            so you don't learn the wrong thing.
                            So I find I don't worry about using the most efficient fingering
                            until I'm playing the hardest version of a song,
                            because that feels pointless, or even counter-productive.
                            This does mean you can end up playing something differently each time,
                            which won't be the fastest way to progress,
                            and pick up bad habits.</p>
                        <p> Some people have experienced lag with this game. I haven't. I just have a HDMI
                            cable from an old PS3 into the TV. Maybe there's lag that I just haven't noticed.</p>
                        <p> The session mode in Rocksmith 2014 is ace for trying things out, learning
                            different scales, and generally learning how to make music instead of just
                            playing other people's. I like this because most of Rocksmith is very geared toward
                            building muscle-memory and roughly hitting the right things at the right times,
                            whereas this is a lot more focused on *listening*.</p>
                        <p> On that note, though, there is a pretty fundamental drawback:
                            there is no 'replay' feature you can use to *listen* to yourself
                            after playing a song
                            and hear what you need to improve.
                            The game is a lot more accurate than I expected,
                            but it's no substitute for an ear,
                            so that omission is a shame.
                            I've heard it was left out because players found it demotivating,
                            but I feel that the choice to listen should be left up to the player.
                            Anyway, I have a mic, so I've just been recording on that,
                            and listening when I feel brave.</p>
                        <p> In general, I think the game is a great tool for increasing dexterity,
                            accuracy, learning some patterns and the basics of various techniques.
                            I think it would be a good resource for learning specific songs,
                            though I haven't done that yet, partly because the tracklist is
                            very geared toward fans of 1990s-2000s indie-grunge-garage,
                            and that's not really where I live. I miss the diversity of styles of Guitar Hero
                            (and the diversity of avatars).
                            I love a mix including psychedelic, blues, new wave, glam, hair metal, progressive,
                            and downright weird.</p>
                        <p>
                            There's some more variety in DLC, but the business model means those tracks are
                            included based on projected sales, so they cater to existing requests rather than
                            introducing people to new things. All in all, I found classic guitar hero a better place
                            for new music suggestions. Which is fine, but also a reason I didn't buy Rocksmith until
                            it was on sale for 60% off.
                            The first game is also a bit weird in that everyone is male,
                            from the tutorial guy to the guitarist in the opening demo to most of the vocalists.
                            Rhythm games have been around a long time;
                            this kind of branding is relatively new to the genre, and,
                            since it coincides with mainstream acceptance of rhythm games as 'real' games
                            (in this country, at least),
                            a bit depressing.
                            But that's a whole other blogpost that I probably don't have the energy to write.
                            Not everyone is male in the intro video of the 2014
                            one, at least, so I guess someone pointed it out as weird.</p>
                        
                            <p>
                            Anyway, Rocksmith can help you to hit the right notes,
                            it can help you to hit notes at the right time,
                            and it can help you to hit the right notes at the right time.
                            It probably can't help you go from that to sounding *good*.
                            But it's a start. 
                            Plus it's motivated my partner to try learning the guitar again,
                            so maybe I'll get a jam buddy sometime. :)</p>

                        <p> This week, <a href="https://dmsimard.com/">David Moreau Simard (irc: dmsimard)</a>
                            was kind enough to
                            praise our work over the last few months on the UI and UX for StoryBoard!
                            <a href="http://sotk.co.uk/about/">Adam Coldrick (irc: SotK)</a> and I* especially enjoy compliments like these,
                            as StoryBoard has been our first foray into frontend development,
                            and we've had to figure out a lot as we've gone along.</p>
                            <p>The company where we work specialises in systems engineering,
                            so we've been very fortunate to gain experience in web-development via working on OpenStack.
                            We've had the opportunity to learn about the web-development
                            ecosystem from people such as <a href="https://krotscheck.net/">Michael Krotscheck </a>
                            (who has both taught us a lot and developed the bulk of StoryBoard before we were involved with the project),
                            and <a href="http://www.logicative.com/">Beth Elwell</a> (who sends UI patches to StoryBoard as a relaxation method!).</p> 
                        
                            <p>So, anyway, we got a compliment!
                               After I'd finished calling up everyone I knew,
                               and telling them to read irc RIGHT NOW,
                               I started wondering: how do we do stuff?
                                For UI and UX design,
                            can we offer any pointers to teams in the same position we were a year ago?</p>
                            <p>I'll probably do this as a series of posts, as and when I remember things. So!
                            Here's the first. I think it's the most important thing,
                            and we saved a lot of time by starting to work this way early on.</p>
                        <p><b>TIP: Dig to find out the actual problem</b></p>
                        <p> There is a fitting Neil Gaiman quote;
                             it's his fourth suggestion over here:</p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one/"><i>
                                "Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them,
                                they are almost always right. 
                                When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it,
                                they are almost always wrong"
                            </i></a></p>
                            <p> -- Neil Gaiman
                            </p>
                         <p> So, that's a quote about creative writing-- but we can generalise!
                             When users have an issue, they will suggest specific implementation changes.
                             When that happens, it's good to step back and establish what they're trying to do and
                             why. 
                             Identifying the root problem allows you to fix the same issue in all its guises,
                             instead of moving buttons around and back again as you try to satisfy contradictory
                             implementation suggestions.
                             Often, you'll find the best change is nothing like the original suggestion.</p>
                        <p>  You need to be active and engaged during this process;
                             it's obvious when people reply with questions for the sake of it, like this:</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  User: Argh, the 'create new task' button is on the left; all the other buttons live
                                   on the right; it's annoying; can it go on the left, too?</p>
                        <p>  Developer: So, what do you want to do when you click that button?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  Well, obviously they want to create a task. Like all development methodologies, don't
                             follow this one dogmatically in cases where it makes no sense. :) Similarly...</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  User: When I search for a tag, it doesn't show all things matching the tag I specify. It should do.</p>
                        <p>  Developer: Why do you want the software to return all things matching the tag, instead of just some?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  That's an extreme example, just to show that you shouldn't ask questions
                             without paying attention, trying to empathise with the user, and attempting
                             to make yourself familiar with the process they want to perform.
                             There *are* related questions that would make sense in that scenario, eg:</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  Developer: Okay, you want a list of everything that matches that tag. Out of interest, how do you then use that
                                        list?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  The user will say something unexpected,
                             and this will reveal a *lot* about how you should present the list.
                             For example, the user might want it laid out a certain way so it'll behave nicely
                             when pasted into some other service, in which case it might be better to
                             create an interface for other services (otherwise, the next user will want a different
                             layout, and the next, etc).
                             You might discover that your software can already solve their problem,
                             as it has this interface already,
                             and you need to draw more attention to the interface.
                             Or, the user might plan to do something with the list that your
                             software can't yet do, in which case you have an early heads-up for a bigger feature request.
</p>
                             <p>
                             So, at this point, you note the use-case; if it seems like a good thing to fix,
                             you plan to implement the fix. If not, you raise your reservations with the user;
                             sometimes one of you will change your mind, sometimes not. If you still don't feel convinced,
                             you put it on the backburner, and wait to see if
                             a chorus of other people raise the same issue-- in which case should also discuss the
                             reservations with them, see what they say, and revisit your assumptions as necessary.</p>
                        <p> You need to be careful with this process. Firstly, if you ask questions just to try to change
                        someone's mind, they will pick up on it and you won't have a productive discussion; you have to 
                        go in with an open mind and be humble about your opinions. Secondly, you should respect the user's
                        time; if the discussion takes too long,
                            the user can get frustrated and think 'other software does this
                            like x, so why can't this team just implement it like x?'. But that ignores the original motivation
                            *not* to use that other piece of software-- people wanted a better implementation,
                            not more of the same. </p>
                        <p>Well, that's that! Hopefully, this will help you feel less overwhelmed when lots of users have
                        different opinions, and you'll be able to discuss and change things more efficiently. Good luck!</p>

                        <p><i>01.10.16</i></p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> This week, I had a traumatic encounter with bad
                            statistics, so I've been thinking a bit about ways in which
                            humans derive conclusions from data. I figured
                            I might as well share it.
                            So! Here are three ways that people perceive the relation
                            between correlation and causation. The first two are
                            likely familiar; the third might not be. I leave it
                            to the reader to decide which way of thinking is the most
                            accurate, which is the most pragmatic, etc: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1) Correlation = Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            It must be really big because it eats sharks!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a lot.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2) Correlation != Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            I wonder if the cat is big because it eats sharks,
                            or if it eats sharks 
                            because it's big enough to fit them in its cat mouth--
                            or some combination of these factors? We need 
                            more evidence to determine the relation!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a fair bit, generally in response to a
                            a claim that implies 1).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3) Causation = Correlation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Hm, when we say thing 1 'causes' thing 2,
                            we just mean that 
                            whenever we see thing 1, thing 2 follows.
                            We then invent a theory to explain this pairing.
                            We don't have any reason to assume that these things
                            will always be paired (it would beg the 
                            question to use the theory, as the theory is based on the 
                            assumption that the pairing will always occur).
                            For all we know, 
                            thing 1 and thing 2 have just always happened to coincide
                            due to random chance. In this case, thing 1 =the size of the 
                            cat; thing 2 = its diet.
                            Even if the cat's
                            size *always* correlates with its food, how do we prove that this
                            isn't just chance? Do we have any reason to suppose we
                            will never see a giant cat that eats only sparrows in the future?'</p>

                        <p>I see that less. That's a quick (and scribbly) sketch
                        of the problem of induction, as it relates to causation. 
                        You can question many explanations' premises 
                        in this way. If someone says : 'We think the reason x and y must 
                        always go together is that z', it's interesting to find out what 
                        'always go together' consists in. If they've spent 2 hours 
                        observing the behaviour of a cat and noted it only eats sharks, 
                        you might be inclined to ignore their theory pending more 
                        convincing evidence.</p>

                        <p>Where this gets fun is the question, 'What constitutes convincing 
                        evidence?'. What if large shark-eating cats have been observed 
                        since the dawn of human civilisation? There are also small cats,
                        that have everything in common, except size and the fact that they never
                        eat sharks. The large cats eat only sharks, and cats that eat sharks are
                        always large. These cats have terrorized humans for sport for as long as 
                        humans have existed... It is known.</p>

                        <p>That seems more compelling (and scary!), but then-- how long has 
                        human civilisation been around, relative to the existence of the 
                        universe? (scientific answer: not very) Even something that 
                        humans have observed every day might not form a substantial body 
                        of evidence relative to the size of, well, everything.</p>

                        <p>You can have some real fun with this. Say you take 'laws of 
                        nature' to be explanatory theories of human observations. Sure, 
                        we've yet to make an observation that contradicts a law of 
                        nature-- but is that particularly significant? We haven't been 
                        around that long. And what about when we're observing something
                        that has been around for much longer than we have?</p>

                        <p>('Laws of nature are explanatory theories of human 
                        observations' is a pretty big assumption to make. I'm just 
                        gesturing so I can give a short overview, but there's an ongoing 
                        debate about whether laws of nature depend on facts, or whether 
                        facts depend on laws of nature. I incline toward the first view, 
                        since I don't see how a human can establish the second. If you'd 
                        like to read a much stronger, more detailed argument and survey 
                        of the landscape, I recommend the works of Helen Beebee;
                        this is a good place to start: 
                        <a href="http://thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Contemporary/Readings/Beebee.pdf">
                        'The Non-Governing Conception of Laws of Nature'</a> .
                        The position mentioned above is generally known as 
                        the Humean view of laws of nature, although Hume himself did not 
                        advocate it (rather, people felt it fit with his philosophy).</p>

                        is famed for laying out the view of causation as 
                        correlation ('constant conjunction'). Section VII here is the 
                        most relevant bit: <a href="http://www.davidhume.org/texts/ehu.html">

                        <br>
                        <p> I haven't been coding for all that long,
                            but I've found that writing a program has a lot in common with writing, well, words.</p>
                        <p> People imply that writing skill has little overlap with coding skill,
                            but I doubt this; writing a program with understandable control flow
                            requires a similar process to
                            writing out a clear explanatory paragraph.
                            This is because clear code and clear writing require empathy for the reader.
                            I think it's just a question of <i>noticing</i> confusing things
                            -- and that comes with practice.
                            Here are some things I personally look out for in my technical docs.
                        </p>
                        <p> I'll skip the obvious things
                            ("don't waffle",
                            "use terms most readers can understand")
                            in favour of two things that are slightly less obvious,
                            so that I'm not repeating advice you can find everywhere else on the internet.</p>
                        <p> It's still not groundbreaking.
                            But maybe it's useful to somebody!
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> First thing:
                            ordering information.</p>
                        <p> Written documents can be disorganised
                            in the same way that a program can be disorganised.
                            This is obvious when whole paragraphs leap around
                            (and most people can notice and fix that),
                            but there's also such a thing as a disorganised sentence.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate with an example,
                            here are two imaginary pieces of documentation:
                        <p> #1</p>
                            <blockquote> First, install foo. Next, do the thing.
                                         Now, do the other thing. Finally, do the last thing.</blockquote>
                        <p>#2</p>
                            <blockquote> Do the thing. Before you do the last thing, do this thing.
                                         Do the other thing.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> How many times have you been burned by something like the second example?
                            What if I rephrase it like this:</p>
                        <blockquote> Run the command. Before you do that, make sure you've set
                                     your environment variable 'x' to 'y'. Now, run the script
                                     baz.py. You will need foo installed for this to work.</blockquote>
                        <p>? I see this <i>all</i> the time. It's the written-word equivalent of spaghetti code.</p>
                        <p> Nobody sets out to write spaghetti code;
                            it happens when people add things as they go along
                            because it wasn't possible to plan.</p>                        
                        <p> I see lots of documentation like the latter example,
                            and I understand how it happens.
                            People write the steps down in the order that the steps come to mind,
                            and sometimes people write a later step
                            before remembering an earlier step.
                            Sometimes another person tacks an earlier step onto the end.</p>
                        <p> That's a normal way to start...
                            and it's much like doing the first sketch of a program
                            (or the flow-chart for a program),
                            before you remember extra things to add,
                            and neaten it up.
                            It's important to reorder things before publishing,
                            so that someone can read instructions in the order of execution*.</p>
                        <p> Writing in order also helps combat ambiguity.
                            In the second sentence of the second example, it's not obvious what 'last'
                            refers to. The previous instruction? Or the final step?
                            It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts those sentences in a sensible order.</p>
                        <p> I think people skip the 'tidy up the order' step
                            either because:
                            a) They don't notice it
                            or
                            b) Documentation is perceived as less important;
                               the bar is set so low that 
                               people are praised for writing any docs at all.
                               Therefore, people don't set time aside for polishing docs.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> Along with writing programs in a sensible order,
                            it's good practice to use meaningful variable names.
                            For example, if you have a function that builds a system,
                            call it 'build_system()', not 'moomoomoo()'.
                            That's common knowledge.
                            But there's a written-word equivalent,
                            that is under-used:
                            referring to a subject or object by name,
                            rather than pronoun.</p>
                        <p> This isn't always necessary,
                            but it matters when the sentence structure could cause ambiguity.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate, here's an example,
                           quoted from above:</p>
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts <i>those sentences</i> in a sensible order
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> In that example,
                            in place of the italicised text,
                            the writer could use 'them':
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts them in a sensible order</blockquote>
                            But that would be harder to skim.
                            A tired reader might think
                            'them' referred to 'subjects'.</p>
                        <p> If you constantly need to refer to things by name,
                            and your prose is getting dry,
                            it's a sign that you should reorder some sentences.
                            Much like how,
                            if a line of code is 500 characters long,
                            the answer isn't to shorten all the variable names to 1 letter,
                            but to split the line up into smaller functions.</p>
                        <p> Well, that's that. I've listed a couple of things that slow
                            readers down when they're trying to scan for important information,
                            that I personally try to avoid.
                            The first is always worth fixing.
                            The second is more of a 'be aware of this and use your judgement' case;
                            you can go too far with it and end up with 'legalese'
                            that's even harder to follow. So be careful!</p>
                        <p> Anyway, when writing technical documentation,
                            the world will thank you
                            if you assume your reader is an insomniac
                            who is operating on about 0.000001% of their potential brainpower
                            (this is me on any given day).</p>
                        <p> That way,
                            us insomniacs will still be able to follow it,
                            and the rest of the world will be able to follow it <i>easily</i>. :)</p>

                    <div class="panel panel-default padded"><p> *This is a reason that I prefer the humble 'for' loop
                            and if/else statements
                            to list comprehensions,
                            even though list comprehensions are more 'pythonic'.
                            The syntax for list comprehensions
                            means that my brain has to jump back and forth.</p>
                        <p> A 'for' loop with if/else goes:
                            <blockquote>for a thing, in this set of things,
                                if x is the case,
                                    do y.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> You can easily lay that out as a series of questions,
                            progressing with each 'yes' answer
                            (and abandoning with any 'no'):</p>
                        <p> 'Here's a thing-- is it in this set? Yes! Is x the case? Yes! Okay, do y.'</p>
                        <p> The list comprehension equivalent is:
                            <blockquote>do y,
                                            for a thing, in this set of things,
                                                if x is the case.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> The questions layout doesn't work here.
                            I find the order hard to keep track of.</p>
                        <p> Maybe this order is preferable when trying to see why something did 'y',
                            and it's designed around debugging.</p>
                        <p> It feels like the reverse of the
                            order in which the instructions are evaluated and executed.
                            And it's the reverse of the order I would interpret an instruction.
                            The criteria that need to be satisfied
                            feel like bracketed afterthoughts,
                            but computers tend not to go,
                            'Okay,
                            I'll run this command
                            and then I'll see if
                            the if statement evaluates to True or False'
                            (and if your computer <i>does</i> behave like this,
                            take it back to the shop).</p>
                            <p>For a more natural languagey example, compare:
                            <blockquote> For each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric,
                                         go inside the shop</blockquote>
                            to
                            <blockquote> Go inside the shop,
                                         for each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> I suppose my ideal would be:
                        <blockquote> On this street,
                                     for each shop,
                                     if the shop stocks fabric,
                                     go inside the shop.</blockquote>
