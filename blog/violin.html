<p>This was originally titled 'learning the violin', but I think
that's too generous.</p>

<p>We have a violin lying around in our house. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/DSC03786.JPG"></p>

<p>It's my partner's; it's purple and glittery because that fit
best with his ambition
to play a violin on a windswept moor in the moonlight.
He took
lessons for about 6 months before abandoning that ambition
in favour of a Steam sale, and
I'd never played it myself. It was only a couple of weeks
ago, three years later, that I remembered the violin existed. </p>

<p>I picked it up and had a play around;
 I was curious and the unique awfulness of a
 violin appealed to my little troll heart.  
Plus I feel like if you have fancy things, 
you should use them
or give them away, and since it wasn't mine to give away but
it was sitting there,
that meant I had to use it (okay, it's a cheap violin,
but if a *violin* isn't the definition of a 'fancy thing', I
don't know what is).</p>

<p>I started out thinking it'd just be funny to
get a recording of me failing to play it to show my friends.
Here's me the first day I picked it up, after about half an
hour or so:</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/170704-000-violin/s-eb0Oq"> First violin attempt </a></p>


<p>When I started, I was... scared of it. It was very loud and very
unpleasant, so I would play a note, get frightened by the sound I'd made, 
faint, and wake an hour later in a cold sweat. 
I couldn't bear to practice
bowing for more than 10 minutes at a time the first couple of 
days, because the sound was so upsetting. </p>

<p>BUT. It sounded SO bad that it felt like the violin was mocking me;
every sharp note was the instrument cackling, 'Hahaha, you 
can't play me!'. And then it became A CHALLENGE
and I had to DEFEAT THE VIOLIN, my FOE. I was not going to let
some purple sparkly violin be the King of *this* Iron Fist 
Tournament.</p>

<p>So I kept coming back to
it, because there had to be SOME WAY to get it to sound good,
and I just had to figure out THE SECRET. And maybe this time
I'd suddenly be able to play it, or maybe now, or maybe *now*, or...</p>

<p>... Well, that hasn't happened yet, but it is weirdly addictive. 
Here's a clip from a week later (probably about 2 hours' total
 practice time between the first one and this one,
though some of that was spent holding it like a guitar and
playing 'Seven Nation Army' on it pizzicato...^^';
I played it for maybe 10-30 minutes a day across a few days,
and spent the rest of the time googling 'how long does it take
to learn to play the violin' in the hopes that it would
magically make me better):</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/violin-1-week/s-7WgT4">Violin after a couple of hours</a></p>

<p>Then I didn't touch it for a week, because I felt guilty
about playing it at all. The main reason I play instruments 
is to make it easier to compose*, so it's a bit of a chore
anyway, and I generally hate
playing instruments if I think other people have to hear.
I especially hate playing instruments
if I know I'm making a horrible sound. So violin-in-a-flat
is not in my comfort zone. But! I wanted to DEFEAT THE VIOLIN,
and that would require me to actually practice on it...</p>

<p>So I ordered a practice mute online 
(if curious, it was
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Violins/Stentor-Music-Co-Ltd-Ultra-Rubber-Violin/B00D7I8BIU"> this one</a> ).
 It made
the violin sound 'wrong'**, but it was much easier to practice
without fear of it making such a loud harsh sound. I could
focus on bowing and intonation without wanting to rush through
pieces just to end the torture, and do more 'technical' practice
without worrying that I'd get an eviction
notice. Though given the following exchange with my partner, I might still get
kicked out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  <i>Me: Hey am I getting better am I am I?</i></p>
<p>  <i>Him: Well... er... I would definitely say you're getting more, erm, *confident* with it...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus I have my critics-- but I think the mute
made a massive difference; this was after 30 minutes' practice
 with the mute (though I took it off for the recording):</p>

<p>It's still unpleasant, but better than it was, I guess.</p>



<p>Other things that changed between the first and last violin
clip:</p>
<p>* I learned how to hold the bow more conventionally and less like
  a saw</p>
<p>* I tightened the bow</p>
<p>* I rosined the bow</p>

<p>And I also somehow broke the chin rest with my face.</p>

                <p> ** I later tried recording a piece with and without the mute, so it was possible to hear the
                     difference. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-868539912/sets/violin-comparison-with-and-without-mute/s-iluaa">
                     Here </a> it is. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>  I've also found that even though I don't play that much (max 1hr a day), try to
                     play quietly, and generally use the mute,
                     my left ear always feels like it's full of cotton wool after practicing.
                     I really wasn't expecting that, though I can't handle loud volumes in general (I sometimes prefer using bad
                     headphones because my mp3 player can't go quiet enough for me with the better ones), so maybe it's not surprising.
                     I've started wearing an earplug in that ear while playing;
                     I didn't want to block out too much noise, and so have finally found a use for
                     the freebie earplugs I get on long haul flights.</p>

                    <p> It's now a little under a month since I first picked up the violin;

                    <p> I am likely to stay on that kind of piece for a while. </p>
                    <p> In an attempt to convince myself I do sometimes make progress,
                        I also recorded some guitar practice, so here it is for contrast (it's much quieter):</p>
