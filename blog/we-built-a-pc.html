                        <br>

                <p>So, last weekend, I built a PC with my partner. We'd been ordering
                parts over the last month, and finally it was time! This post
                is just a collection of thoughts about how it went for us.
                If you want a 'how to build a PC' post,
                there are lots of others online, written by people
                more knowledgeable than I am. (This post isn't even a useful
                collection of links, since we didn't go to any particular website
                and just searched things as we went along.)</p>

                <p>I've wanted to build my own PC since I was a teenager. I
                didn't do it in those days because it cost money,
                I had no internet access, 
                and  all my liquid assets were in the form of HMV tokens. Then I
                moved out and lived at a different address every year
                for half a decade, and my laptop covered my needs.
                I game a little, but my games tend to be about twenty
                years old-- a remnant of only buying preowned games as a kid.
                So, owning a desktop didn't make much sense.</p>

                <p>But! I work in software now. I'm thus picking up dangerous habits,
                such as making software.</p>

                <p>My home laptop is a Lenovo B570e, with
                an i3 processor, windows 7 Home Premium and 4GB of RAM.
                I adore it (it's a machine that historically has done what I need
                it to do and nothing else),
                but as I started spinning up more virtual machines to try things out, I'd
                get frustrated by the loading times. As well as virtual machines,
                there were some tools I was curious about (hi there unreal engine);
                my laptop would see the minimum requirements for them and laugh.
                More and more, I wanted to be able to send a quick
                patch for StoryBoard without waiting 15mins for a VM to wake up.
                I wanted to play pythonpython in real time...</p>

                <p>I decided I needed better hardware.</p>

                <p>My partner wanted to play newer games and had also wanted to
                build a PC for a while, so we agreed to split the cost down
                the middle and go for it. This was probably
                stupid because neither of us had built a PC before; I'd used
                an antistatic mat once at work and we'd made some LEDs light
                up via an arduino one time. So, hardware experts, right there.</p>

                <p>Buuuut we also knew we'd wonder
                'what if' if we did a practice build with parts we didn't care about,
                and probably end up spending more overall, so we decided to just do it.</p>

                <p>We used pcpartpicker to pick stuff out, based roughly on my
                partner's
                friend's recent build. The most fun part of this was seeing what kind
                of wacky things were out there. We discovered one vendor had made
                a computer case shaped like a train, that could move down a little track:</p>

                <br>
                <p>There were also some fantastically garish peripherals:</p>

                <p>In true bikeshed fashion, the bit that
                took the longest to pick was the keyboard. I tried asking
                an esteemed colleague what he'd gone for, only to discover
                he'd bought one that retailed for 190 quid. I decided that the keys must be made of
                gold bullion, he was a bad role model, and I should ignore him.</p>

                <p>In the end, the pressure was too much. My partner and I gave up and got 
                some Logitech business keyboard for about a tenner.</p>

                <p class="text-center"><i> This sort of thing.</i>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Once we had all our parts, it was time to build the computer!
                We didn't know what we were doing, but figured
                it looked fairly easy. Our past victories included two ikea
                tables, a chest of drawers and a massive wardrobe, so... 
                exactly the same thing!</p>

                <p>Putting the pieces together was straightforward,
                though
                I had a heart-stopping moment where I thought I'd destroyed the
                motherboard by screwing in the cooler too tight, despite
                trying to be as careful as possible because I was scared I'd
                overtighten it! Protip:
                when the cooler manual depicts a screwdriver, you'd better finger-tighten,
                just as you were doing before you saw the screwdriver in the
                manual and thought it was important to tighten more than
                expected, with a screwdriver... (This was a Cooler Master Hyper
                and a Gigabyte z170x Gaming 7, if anyone's curious)</p>

                <p>Anyway, I was pretty heartbroken (I'd been so scared of overtightening
                that I'd only *nudged* the screws with the screwdriver
                and I have no physical strength *anyway*,; it was so unfair!).
                I feared that if we kept going and it
                *was* damaged, we'd short everything and lose all our
                material wealth.
                On the other hand, the motherboard wasn't cheap enough to just toss away,
                and we'd *finally* got all the parts, plus it was a Saturday night
                so there was no chance of getting next-day delivery for a
                replacement, so it'd be another week before we'd have time to
                try again. Such a dilemma...</p>

                <p>We stopped, took the cooler off, and took a look
                at the damage. It turned out to be far less than it seemed; I'd
                pulled up some of the transparent motherboard coating, but the
                traces seemed to be intact and things were only cosmetically scuffed.
                So we carried on, and I was relieved to have not burned around
                150 pounds. (Though only time will tell for sure...:( )</p>

                <p>Based on general trends we noticed in guides around the internet,
                we did things in the order: cpu-motherboard, cooler-motherboard,
                ram-motherboard, motherboard-case, PSU-case, cables, wifi card,
                video card . This worked. My partner's friend was impressed
                when we mentioned we'd assembled things with the case standing
                up, but that's a lot easier when there are two of you-- though
                building it standing did mean we nearly knocked it off the table
                a few times, so that was scary.</p>

                <p>The cooler was by far the trickiest bit to assemble and attach.
                It took us a while to notice that the instructions for multiple
                different types of boards were all lumped together on the page,
                and that not all the parts were relevant to us, 
                as they supplied parts for lots of different boards so you could
                just use the ones that matched yours.</p>


                <p>Also, at first we didn't realise the cooler screws could be repositioned
                to fit our board (I spent an embarrassingly long time going 'if
                only these screws could go into the middle of this space, then
                they'd fit' before I realised that they *could* go into the
                middle if I moved them the correct way. This was a cooler master
                hyper with a gigabyte z170x gaming 7, for reference, in case it
                would be useful to anyone to end up here through a search...
                There is a picture in the manual for this, but we missed it,
                and the manual also contains a picture of a screwdriver, so.).</p>

                <p>Most of the rest was just 'plug thing A into slot B', where the
                components only fit in the place they were meant to live. An encouraging
                thing I've picked up from work is that, when people say 'this
                is nice hardware', half the time they just mean 'it has
                labels and I am able to tell what things are' (I think this is
                often true of programming languages, for that matter).</p>

                <p>Both our case
                (corsair 450D; we didn't get the train)
                and components were well-labelled, and on the whole the
                cable labels matched up with the motherboard labels, so that made
                life easier. I think one of the cable labels said 'sw' where the
                motherboard expected 'ps', for 'power switch', or something
                like that, but the manuals made it possible to work out what was going on.
                It also took me a little while to work out that there were two
                rows for pins on the front panel bit of the motherboard, and the cover for them
                used one side to indicate things on the top row and the other side
                for things on the bottom row; at first I was confused the sides
                of the cover were different. I don't know how to express
                this any more clearly without pointing, and I'm too lazy to take pictures,
                sorry. Also I didn't know what it was called at the time and just
                looked at the manual now to discover it's referred to as the 'front panel',
                which makes sense since those connections are for things on the front panel
                of the case...</p>

                <p>Once we
                had most components hooked up (though not the graphics card,
                just in case my motherboard damage was worse than we thought
                and it fried things), we
                tried plugging in the monitor and seeing if it could boot to bios.
                It was the moment of truth...</p>

                <p>It booted!</p>

                <p>Things seemed sensible. Well, the BIOS were ridiculous in that
                they had *bevelled edges* and a *cursor* with a *gradient*
                 (I'm used to a more 70s look), but everything worked.
                The RAM reported was the amount we
                thought we'd put in. The temperature seemed comfortable. The
                processor's specs matched those on the box. We were kinda amazed
                that there was an LED in the case that showed numbers
                (apparently they're error codes...) and a backlit power symbol.
                We were living in the future.</p>

                <p>After we'd had enough time to bask in our newfound
                status as People Who Could Build A Computer And Were Basically
                Like The Smartest People Ever And Did You See That It 
                Turned On And Everything, 
                we turned the computer off, and added the graphics card. We had to move
                the wifi card since we'd put that in the middle for some reason
                (maybe, just maybe not the smartest people ever?),
                and there wasn't room, but it was pretty quick to fix.</p>

                <p>After that, we installed the various drives.  Working out how
                to take off the cover for the optical drive was time-consuming,
                probably because by this point it was about midnight and I
                had been ready to fall asleep when we started at 7pm. We
                eventually realised we needed to reach into the drive from within
                the case and push some tabs in to free it, so it was simple enough,
                just took a while to look in the right place.</p>

                <p> It also
                took us a while to locate the SSD bay (I'm still not convinced
                it didn't spontaneously appear on the back of the case when
                we needed it).</p>

                <p> Once we'd attached all
                our drives, and the remaining cables (the sata cables were
                fiddly), we tidied things up and checked it still worked.
                The computer booted again! And now, the graphics card glowed, too!
                Which was good because there was a dragon on it, and it's really
                important for you to have a tiny glowing LED dragon. It
                actually
                makes the computer run faster, because the computer doesn't
                want to look weak in front of the dragon. There are journals about it.*</p>

                <p>After
                we'd put the case sides back on, we noticed the back fan wasn't
                working. My partner wanted to fix it right then, but it was 1am
                and I overruled him with 'you are tired and you will end up
                knocking the computer off the table; we do this tomorow'.
                So we stopped for the evening.</p>

                <p>The next day, we showed OUR GLORIOUS NEW COMPUTER to his friend who was
                visiting. We turned it on, and at first there was no display,
                which filled us with dread.
                We eventually realised we'd actually received two VGA cables with
                our PSU, one of which had more pins to connect than the other
                (we thought they were both the same so didn't question having
                a spare port on the graphics card to plug something in, assuming
                that was for a different make of cable. Told you we were experts).
                So, if you get an EVGA fully modular power supply,
                be aware that the VGA cables might
                be different to each other.<p>
                <p>
                We swapped out the VGA-PSU cable and tried again (funnn, since it plugged
                into the PSU
                at the bottom at the back of the case); this time we
                got a picture.
                Finally, we fulfiled my partner's dream of sorting out the back fan, and
                THE DEVICE WAS COMPLETE.</p>

                <p>Later that day I installed the first OS, but I'll save that for
                a separate post, because this one's far too long already.</p>

                <p>So! Building a computer is really fun, and straightforward!
                If you have no idea what you're doing, you can
                learn just before you do stuff and you'll be okay!
                It's easier than many things! Check the manuals sometimes!
                There's a lot of light puzzle solving! People will say it takes
                2 hours; those people have probably done some of it before
                or spent more time reading up on the details first! 
                It probably took us about
                6 hours, working slowly and carefully and going back and checking
                things a lot, including reattaching the cooler! 
                Be careful with that cooler! It's yet another
                thing that's easier than developing in angularjs!</p>

                <p>I love being in a position where I have
                 the freedom to do this sort of thing, and I'm also glad to live 
                with someone who likes to do things
                like build a computer with me. There was a pretty even balance of
                'you're doing it wrong; it should be like this' from both of us,
                so we were both pleased about that, and he was kind
                about the potential motherboard disaster.
                (In terms of relationship-building,
                'building a computer' maybe doesn't rank <i>as</i> highly as
                 'going to dinner with another couple
                to remind you of all the reasons why your partner is so much better',
                but you get a computer out of it, which beats an awkward evening.)</p>

                <p>So, that's that! You should probably do it more sensibly than we did it,
                but building a PC is definitely worth it if you
                want something with good hardware; you probably don't save that much
                money (because you end up spending more getting better parts than
                you really need, and every time you try to look into finding a cheaper
                part, you instead end up upgrading to one that costs
                twice as much as your old choice...), but you get better value for money.
                You learn a lot, and it makes you feel less afraid to replace
                components in the future for fear of breaking everything,
                as you put them in there in the first place. And, most importantly,
                you get to say that you built your own PC!</p>

                    I do own a rhinestone-studded mouse shaped
                    like a mouse (the ears are the buttons),
                    and I'm sure after this goes up I will regret
                    publically admitting to that. There may be a picture at some point.

                    It looks like a transformer... Why does it look like a transformer...? 
                    Anyway, we've since discovered that the LEDs don't turn off unless the computer is turned
                    off at the back, and there's no way to change them from the 'slowly change colours'
                    setting. It's a weird thing to have in your house, but I regret nothing.</i></p>
