                        <p>
                        Yesterday I was chatting about maths things, and mentioned
                        offhand that people who are better at geometery than I am
                        tend to also outrank me at picturing objects in their minds.
                        My mathsy colleague (hi, SotK!) 
                        talked about being able to picture things
                        like a little
                        house that he could rotate, zoom in on, stand next to, walk around;
                         he could add some trees and a pond to the back garden.</p>
                         
                        <p>My responses were mainly incredulity and allcaps 
                        'BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT
                        IS IN VIEW AND WHAT IS OUT OF VIEW', even though I've met plenty
                        of other people who can do this. It always makes me feel like
                        I'm one of the last survivors of a different species,
                        away from which these people have evolved.
                        So here is a very long post on my experience; writing it out
                        helps me think more clearly about it, and I figure it should be
                        public since I love coming
                        across other people's and seeing how radically different they are.
                        If you're not interested in a long essay on what it's like to be
                        a Zara, this is not the place for you (but why are you on my blog?
                        It is a really boring blog! You will be <i>so</i> much happier
                        elsewhere! Be free, be free!)</p>

                        <p>So. I am awful at visualising things, to the point where I'm not sure
                        if I can at <i>all</i>. If someone says 'imagine an ice cream cone', I
                        am aware of a wavy-edged white thing of a certain size, 
                        that I know is Mr. Whippy shaped (instead of, say, round) but
                        couldn't actually draw if prompted because I don't know what
                        its precise shape is (well, that's not quite true. I could
                        draw it but I'd be working out its shape based on what I already
                        had on the page). I picture its colours, and
                        I picture a crisscross raised (I feel it) texture that I know 
                        is on the cone,
                         but don't actually 'see' on the cone (again, if I tried to draw
                        it, I wouldn't know where exactly it was). If I try to picture
                        it on the cone, I get a completely different angle, 
                        and the edges are a mystery.
                         I get a lot of background sound; I hear someone biting
                        it and can imagine the movements of little crumbs falling off,
                        from another perspective entirely. I know the ice cream
                        is on top of the cone but I can't picture the place the ice cream
                        and cone
                        intersect; when I try, I picture a flash of an empty ice cream
                        cone instead, from a different angle, and I'm not sure what
                        that looks like really (I get a circle with spokes, but I don't think
                        I'm imagining it consistently from one perspective all the way
                         round, so it's more a collection of partial circles with spokes, 
                        as that's what I 'know' it looks like).</p>

                        <p>So yeah, my impressions of all the 'components' of the ice
                        cream are from different perspectives and distances, 
                        in different positions,
                        and very very vague anyway. The best way I can describe it is
                        when you are shown a flash of video for a fraction of a second
                         and then try to recall it, 
                        and there's just a distorted, vague after-image. 
                        Though it's possible other people's experience of
                        *that* phenomenom differs from mine, so that might not be
                        helpful at all. And also it's after-images of multiple videos,
                         shifting and dissolving into each other
                        and never being clear to begin with.
                        They're being drawn in invisible ink,
                        so the only bit I'm aware of is the motion of drawing;
                        it can feel like
                        there is an image going on *somewhere*, but I can't see it.
                        And it's more like an after-image of experience than
                        an after-image of video since other senses are squooshed in there. I
                        get a bunch of disparate, weak data, some realistic, some
                        cartoonish, including a summery light
                        quality and a sense of the 'icecreamness' of the icecream,
                        some wave sounds, some kids yelling, vague sea smell, vague
                        ice cream smell, 
                        vague ice cream cone smell, feel of ice cream cone in hand, 
                        a wasp's sound and movement, impressions of
                        all sorts of other things related to ice creams, etc...</p>


                        <p>I *can* picture colours, and their distribution, and 
                        (probably the same thing? )
                        light quality. I can picture textures,
                        sort of (I think I'm getting a mix of colours, sensation to the touch
                        and how light hits a thing). I have a sense of where things are
                        in 3d space; if I close my eyes, there's a left, a right, an up,
                        a down, and things can be nearer or further from me. I just can't
                        picture the things themselves. I can only picture very basic
                        shapes 'as' movements; if I think of a vase, I actually think of
                        a single point moving in the way it would move were I to draw the
                        side of a vase, and I 'feel' it in my hand. 
                        I could tell you what the vase was made of and picture its texture, 
                        just not its
                        shape (at least, not all at once). In that vein, I can tell if a line
                        is wavy or straight, but not precisely where it ends and begins
                        (at the same time, anyway), and it's more like I 'know' it's
                        wavy and can trace over the waves than that I 'see' the waves. I
                        'feel' volumes; I don't see them.</p>

                        <p>Visualising other senses is fine. I can imagine sounds easily,
                        along with textures, smells and (more weakly) tastes. I think
                        I do a lot of it without noticing when I imagine visual things. 
                        When I imagine something, my body simulates its response; 
                        when I picture a smell, I feel it in my
                        nose, which scrunches if it's a bad smell, and taste it in
                        my mouth
                        (if it's a bad smell my throat might close and my stomach might tense up).
                        Similarly, if I picture a sound moving around behind my head, I feel 
                        it move (though I actually seem to track it with my eyes and
                        cheeks/jaw, and
                        when I asked my partner, he found he also used his eyes. Weird.). </p>

                        <p>When you look at objects in real life, you move your eyes a lot
                        without noticing, to perceive the whole object; in general only
                        a tiny fraction is in focus at any moment. (eg: read a sentence,
                        feel your eyes move; try to work out how many words you actually
                        *see* at a time. 
                        I get about three letters in focus and a blur of everything else in
                        my field of vision, then quickly move my eyes to see more,
                        normally without noticing). I feel like my mental images are kind of
                        like that, only I can't move from one image to the next to
                        construct a bigger shape, because the blurred background gets replaced
                        with nothingness, and there's no way to focus in on nothing. 
                        My colleague and
                        I joked
                        that I'm missing a module 
                        and need to install some graphics capabilities in my brain;
                        maybe my head's overzealous about back-face culling. I
                        do see things in dreams, that look like real things, so that
                        might suggest it's not a storage problem, but a problem with recall. 
                        (And yes, this whole post is just description and vague speculation; 
                        I'm too lazy to do any
                        real philosophy on it right now, so best not reading it as such.)</p>

                        <p>So, when I try
                        to picture something visual, it's like my eyes try to find it,
                        but can't tell where to focus, and each time they *change* focus,
                        I lose the whole picture and get a different one. So I can
                        picture a single point, and I can picture it moving from one
                        place to another, but I can't picture the line between the
                        starting point and the ending point, as I lose the starting point
                        when I change focus. My partner says he doesn't move his eyes or
                        focus with his eyes at all when picturing visual things; 'they
                        come from the back of my mind on a screen'. BUT WHERE IS THAT.</p>


                        <p>We also discovered that I find it easier to imagine things if
                        my eyes are open; then I can picture a basic line or shape
                        extending off something in my field of vision, or resting on
                        top of something else, etc. My partner finds it easier to imagine
                        things with his eyes closed, 
                        as it feels like a totally different process
                        to seeing things with his eyes. I quizzed him a bit on what
                        happens with basic shapes, and we had this exchange:</p>

                        <blockquote>Me: I can picture the number '3', but it's more like I picture a
                            point of light tracing out the shape of the 3, that leaves
                            a brief afterimage, and I feel it in my hand</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Him: I think mine is showing off now because I'm picturing a 3D
                             '3' rotating</blockquote>

                        <p>WHAT. HOW. YOUR BRAIN CAN'T JUST *DO* THAT. THAT'S SOME X-FILES
                        NONSENSE.</p>

                        <p>So yeah, I'm not sure I can picture any still shape.
                         I think I can only picture movements, colours and proportions.
                         I can also
                        picture light; I sometimes give myself headaches by picturing
                        bright light, and feel the muscles around my eyes tense 
                        (once you've remembered you can do it it's really
                        hard not to do it...). Well, not sure if I see it or just
                        simulate my response to it, but it feels the same...</p>

                        <p>My partner can't picture smells at all. I think that's pretty common,
                        but seems strange to me since smells seem so much simpler than
                        pictures. It feels like there's less data to get confused by, with smells.</p>

                        <p>I've seen several blogposts on 'aphantasia': a lack of inner
                        visual imagery-- but that doesn't quite fit for me. It's more like
                        I have a texturing, positioning and animation studio, 
                        and someone just left out the drawing bit. 
                        Given a bunch of components, I can arrange
                        them in space, colour them in and move them around-- 
                        I just can't
                        make or see the components themselves. 
                        It makes no sense but that's what
                        my brain does, and it's possible that 'location in space' or
                        'movement' is not visual data to me but more simulated physical movement. 
                        But I don't see what else light and colour could be,
                        so I figure I've got some visual imagination going on. I also
                        wonder whether it correlates with eye-quality at all;
                        I'm so shortsighted that things start to blur 5in from my face.</p>

                        <p>I always thought it'd be cool to be able to visualise objects,
                        since then drawing from imagination would be like drawing from
                        observation, and I could create fantasy worlds.
                        But maybe my brain does other cool stuff to compensate, 
                        that I can't identify because I'm the one experiencing it.
                        A lot of people seem to find it harder to make up melodies than I do;
                        I could just tell myself my box swapped a beetle for
                        a Beatle. (I'm sorry, nobody deserved that...) But yeah,
                        everyone else gets a sci-fi superpower; I want one, too.
                        Please let me know if you notice it.</p>

                        <p>This whole thing also reminds me of being a kid and trying
                        to run fast with my head rather than my legs. I'd try to speed
                        up by tensing my body up. I don't think I realised
                        I could move my legs 'without thinking about them' instead until 
                        I was in my mid-teens. It felt like the roadrunner animation!
                        So maybe I'm capable of picturing objects,
                        and I've just spent my whole life doing it wrong. That'd be pretty
                        funny.</p>
                        
                        <p>This also means I intend to write some pygame-dev-helpers for
                        displaying the coordinates of objects in space, etc, for poor
                        souls like me, who can only picture a complete object by literally drawing
                        it. I'm considering basing something on
                        <a href="https://github.com/Zarathecat/badpaint">badpaint</a>
                        for it. Need to give it some thought, and find out what exists
                        already. I just know I'm wasting
                        a lot of time working similar geometry out repeatedly,
                        and hey, my maths teacher always
                        said the best mathematician is a lazy mathematician. :)</p>
