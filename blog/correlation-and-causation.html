                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> This week, I had a traumatic encounter with bad
                            statistics, so I've been thinking a bit about ways in which
                            humans derive conclusions from data. I figured
                            I might as well share it.
                            So! Here are three ways that people perceive the relation
                            between correlation and causation. The first two are
                            likely familiar; the third might not be. I leave it
                            to the reader to decide which way of thinking is the most
                            accurate, which is the most pragmatic, etc: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1) Correlation = Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            It must be really big because it eats sharks!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a lot.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2) Correlation != Causation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Wow, that cat is really big! It only eats sharks!
                            I wonder if the cat is big because it eats sharks,
                            or if it eats sharks 
                            because it's big enough to fit them in its cat mouth--
                            or some combination of these factors? We need 
                            more evidence to determine the relation!'</p>
                        <p> I see that a fair bit, generally in response to a
                            a claim that implies 1).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3) Causation = Correlation</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>'Hm, when we say thing 1 'causes' thing 2,
                            we just mean that 
                            whenever we see thing 1, thing 2 follows.
                            We then invent a theory to explain this pairing.
                            We don't have any reason to assume that these things
                            will always be paired (it would beg the 
                            question to use the theory, as the theory is based on the 
                            assumption that the pairing will always occur).
                            For all we know, 
                            thing 1 and thing 2 have just always happened to coincide
                            due to random chance. In this case, thing 1 =the size of the 
                            cat; thing 2 = its diet.
                            Even if the cat's
                            size *always* correlates with its food, how do we prove that this
                            isn't just chance? Do we have any reason to suppose we
                            will never see a giant cat that eats only sparrows in the future?'</p>

                        <p>I see that less. That's a quick (and scribbly) sketch
                        of the problem of induction, as it relates to causation. 
                        You can question many explanations' premises 
                        in this way. If someone says : 'We think the reason x and y must 
                        always go together is that z', it's interesting to find out what 
                        'always go together' consists in. If they've spent 2 hours 
                        observing the behaviour of a cat and noted it only eats sharks, 
                        you might be inclined to ignore their theory pending more 
                        convincing evidence.</p>

                        <p>Where this gets fun is the question, 'What constitutes convincing 
                        evidence?'. What if large shark-eating cats have been observed 
                        since the dawn of human civilisation? There are also small cats,
                        that have everything in common, except size and the fact that they never
                        eat sharks. The large cats eat only sharks, and cats that eat sharks are
                        always large. These cats have terrorized humans for sport for as long as 
                        humans have existed... It is known.</p>

                        <p>That seems more compelling (and scary!), but then-- how long has 
                        human civilisation been around, relative to the existence of the 
                        universe? (scientific answer: not very) Even something that 
                        humans have observed every day might not form a substantial body 
                        of evidence relative to the size of, well, everything.</p>

                        <p>You can have some real fun with this. Say you take 'laws of 
                        nature' to be explanatory theories of human observations. Sure, 
                        we've yet to make an observation that contradicts a law of 
                        nature-- but is that particularly significant? We haven't been 
                        around that long. And what about when we're observing something
                        that has been around for much longer than we have?</p>

                        <p>('Laws of nature are explanatory theories of human 
                        observations' is a pretty big assumption to make. I'm just 
                        gesturing so I can give a short overview, but there's an ongoing 
                        debate about whether laws of nature depend on facts, or whether 
                        facts depend on laws of nature. I incline toward the first view, 
                        since I don't see how a human can establish the second. If you'd 
                        like to read a much stronger, more detailed argument and survey 
                        of the landscape, I recommend the works of Helen Beebee;
                        this is a good place to start: 
                        <a href="http://thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Contemporary/Readings/Beebee.pdf">
                        'The Non-Governing Conception of Laws of Nature'</a> .
                        The position mentioned above is generally known as 
                        the Humean view of laws of nature, although Hume himself did not 
                        advocate it (rather, people felt it fit with his philosophy).</p>

                        <p> In general, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

                        <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/">David Hume</a>
                        is famed for laying out the view of causation as 
                        correlation ('constant conjunction'). Section VII here is the 
                        most relevant bit: <a href="http://www.davidhume.org/texts/ehu.html">
                        'An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'</a>
                        . He's a clear writer, as 18th century philosophers go
                        (and clearer than many contemporary philosophers, unfortunately),
                        so enjoy!</p>
                        
                        <p> And that's that. If nothing else, I had fun writing that out.</p>
