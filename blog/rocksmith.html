                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> I planned to do a bunch of stuff this holiday.
                            I was going to pick up where I left off on
                            <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>
                            (day 10, I think)
                            and save Xmas from the malevolvent Easter Bunny.
                            I was going to send some patches to
                            <a href="https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/page/about">StoryBoard</a>.
                            I was going to get the 
                            <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
                            out of the drawer
                            and make it do something festive.
                            I was going to write some games, get more familiar
                            with <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>,
                            learn some C++, finally move on from plate
                            29 in 
                            <i><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1421684.Drawing_the_Head_and_Hands">'Drawing the Head and Hands'</a></i>,
                            rewrite the novel,
                            make progress with the keyboard and the classical guitar,
                            decorate, maybe finish some embroidery...</p>
                        <p> Then I bought Rocksmith.</p>
                        <p> And that's the story of how I forsook my former life for the electric guitar.</p>
                        
                        <p> For the uninitiated: it's like guitar hero,
                            but you use an actual guitar.
                            People asked me some questions about whether it was good for learning the
                            guitar, so I thought I'd summarize my experience here.</p>
                        <p> First, some context, since this kind of thing will totally
                            depend on your prior experience.
                            
                        <p> On the gaming side,
                            I love rhythm games and played dancing stage and guitar
                            hero to death. (A longer list is more like: Dancing Stage, 
                            Parappa the Rapper, Dance: UK,
                            Stepmania, Amplitude, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Patapon, Audiosurf,
                            Vib Ribbon, Space Channel 5... rhythm games are probably my fave genre,
                            so I've played a lot of obscure ones over the years.)
                            That side of things is very familiar to me, and I'm good at them through
                            repetition if nothing else.</p>
                            
                        <p> On the 'actually playing a guitar' side,
                            I've been learning the guitar for
                            a couple of years. I have two.
                            My first is a classical, the Valencia 3100A.
                            This was about 60GBP off Amazon; that is an AWFUL way to buy
                            guitars and you should never do it,
                            but I was lucky and mine sounds nice.
                            Although it might even be a fake 
                            (online pictures of the 'same' guitar
                            look different to mine)...
                        </p>
                        <p> My second is an electric <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/Products/SG/G-400-PRO.aspx">Epiphone G400 Pro</a>
                            that I bought for my birthday after a year,
                            once I was sure I wouldn't just drop the hobby; at that point
                            I thought I could spend more and get something that'd age well. ALSO, IT'S SHINY.</p>
                        <p>
                            Before starting, I was able to read music,
                            and had been learning to play the keyboard for about 6 months.
                            I can't play any other instruments.
                            My brain seems to lean heavily toward music,
                            but I have no awareness of my own body and it
                            takes me forever to learn movements.
                            So it takes me a decade or two to learn a bar,
                            and my playing is often indistinguishable from someone repeatedly dropping the instrument on the floor.</p>
                        <p> 
                            I'm probably best classed somewhere from 'experienced beginner' to 'early intermediate'.
                            I've been learning the two styles of guitar at the same time;
                            'pop' guitar via the <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a>
                            series, and 'classical' guitar
                            mainly via <a href="http://jasonwaldron-guitarist.com.au/classical_guitar_manual.html">this book</a>.
                            For a year I learned both styles on the same guitar.
                            (It's an interesting experience;
                            it feels a lot like playing two different instruments that happen
                            to be shaped the same way, and the notes and chords 'feel' different.)
                            A classical guitar has a much wider neck and more spaced out frets,
                            so my flimsy justification for buying the shiny electric was that I'd be able
                            to do things like power chords without crying, along with
                            things I couldn't do on a classical, such as sustains and string bending...
                            </p>
                        <p> What actually happened is that I much preferred the harp-like sound of the
                            classical and just ended up playing on that most of the time.
                            When I did play the electric,
                            the metal strings sounded 'wrong',
                            and
                            I'd get frustrated at my relative lack of dexterity
                            with the pick. So I'd switch to using my fingers, and wouldn't learn much
                            specific to the electric.
                            </p>
                            
                        <p> Enter Rocksmith!</p>
                        <p> I think the biggest benefit of this game is that it takes you out of your comfort zone.
                            I quickly found it didn't register things very well if I used my fingers,
                            so I had no choice but to switch to the pick.
                            I discovered that,
                            judging from how far my picking hand was from the right string,
                            my picking hand thought the right string was in a different room.
                            Well, pride destroyed, but I can see (and hear) the accuracy improving from day to day.
                            You could argue that if I'm not going to pick,
                            I don't need to learn it,
                            but I'd like to have the option of playing fast things on the electric if I want to,
                            and I prefer the tone anyway (fingers sound a bit muddy when strumming).</p>
                        <p> In a similar vein, it makes you play music/styles that you otherwise wouldn't play.
                            There's very little on the tracklist I've even listened to before,
                            let alone wanted to play. That could be frustrating if you wanted the game
                            to teach you specific songs (though there is (pricey) DLC),
                            but I was more interested in building technical ability
                            and getting more familiar with my electric so I could
                            go off and learn whatever I wanted.
                            So, along the way, I'm learning techniques that I wouldn't otherwise look at
                            (for any length of time, anyway), and I think that makes my playing more rounded.
                            At the moment I'm just powering through songs to scrape enough points
                            to unlock things, so I'm not really trying to
                            learn any songs, but I'm still finding I'm memorizing things
                            and can play a bunch of new riffs from memory. And hey,
                            I've found some new bands to listen to.</p>
                        <p> Another nice part is that the game rewards you for hitting streaks of notes,
                            but you get extra points for using the relevant techniques.
                            So this is a pretty effective way for practicing stuff like palm-muting and slides,
                            without penalizing you if you get the right notes and just miss the technique.
                            There are also some great minigames;
                            'ducks' (hit ducks by fretting the right note)
                            is good for getting comfortable
                            jumping around the whole neck of the guitar;
                            until now I've mainly been playing in
                            first position, so this has been great for things from the 5th fret.
                            A version including note names would be even better for subconscious memorization,
                            but working out the note names at the start and then singing them each time they
                            come up will work in its absence.
                            There's also a zombie shooter in which you have to hit chords as fast as possible,
                            which is pretty good practice.</p>
                        <p> Even with experience of a billion rhythm games,
                            it takes a while to get the hang of reading the notes on screen;
                            I'm still not totally comfortable with it. The yellow and orange look similar
                            (A and G string respectively), so I get them mixed up sometimes.
                            Similar things happen with the '3' and '5' (for 3rd and 5th fret).
                            It's hard to see the 'shape' of upcoming
                            music, so you might play through something a few times with awkward fingering before
                            realising it's just an arpeggiated D7 or something like that.
                            When I started, I was confused because all the notes seemed to be 'upside down'
                            and I couldn't explain what was 'upside down' about them or why I felt so disoriented by it.
                            It turns out the strings are displayed (by default) as the inverse of tab,
                            so the low E string is at the top.
                            You can fix this and flip them back in Game Settings,
                            and I'm forever indebted to whomever argued for that feature.
                            I can see the argument that some beginners may find it easier,
                            but it will make things more difficult for them later when they want to play tab
                            (and also traditional notation, since higher notes are higher on the stave).
                            (And add my voice to the chorus asking for an option for horizontal scrolling tab.)</p>
                        <p> A fun side-effect to learning 'pop' guitar for a couple of years first is that I
                            started with chords. So while my picking is clumsy and inaccurate,
                            having done almost no 'lead' practice,
                            I'm pretty comfortable changing between basic chords fast.
                            The game treats chords as more difficult than single notes,
                            so it introduces them after you hit a high enough percentage of single notes
                            in a song.
                            So, because of the order in which I learned things, 
                            this is like unlocking 'easy' mode after battling through 'hard' mode,
                            so that's fun (thanks, Justin guitar!)! It was a bit of a relief the first time,
                            since I was starting to wonder whether I'd hallucinated being able to play
                            the guitar a bit...</p> 
                            
                        <p> The 'dynamic difficulty' (game gives you more notes to play when you do stuff right)
                            does mean that you're learning multiple
                            different songs per song,
                            since the best fingering for a note depends on
                            what else you're playing around it,
                            and that changes.
                            It feels better not to 
                            build up too much muscle-memory until you're playing the hardest version of a song
                            so you don't learn the wrong thing.
                            So I find I don't worry about using the most efficient fingering
                            until I'm playing the hardest version of a song,
                            because that feels pointless, or even counter-productive.
                            This does mean you can end up playing something differently each time,
                            which won't be the fastest way to progress,
                            and pick up bad habits.</p>
                        <p> Some people have experienced lag with this game. I haven't. I just have a HDMI
                            cable from an old PS3 into the TV. Maybe there's lag that I just haven't noticed.</p>
                        <p> The session mode in Rocksmith 2014 is ace for trying things out, learning
                            different scales, and learning how to make music instead of just
                            playing other people's. I like this because most of Rocksmith is very geared toward
                            building muscle-memory and hitting the right things at the right times,
                            whereas this is a lot more focused on *listening*.</p>
                        <p> On that note, though, there is a pretty fundamental drawback:
                            there is no 'replay' feature you can use to *listen* to yourself
                            after playing a song
                            and hear what you need to improve.
                            The game is a lot more accurate than I expected,
                            but it's no substitute for an ear,
                            so that omission is a shame.
                            I've heard it was left out because players found it demotivating,
                            but I feel that the choice to listen should be left up to the player.
                            Anyway, I have a mic, so I've just been recording on that,
                            and listening when I feel brave.</p>
                        <p> In general, I think the game is a great tool for increasing dexterity,
                            accuracy, learning some patterns and the basics of various techniques.
                            I think it would be a good resource for learning specific songs,
                            though I haven't done that yet, partly because the tracklist is
                            very geared toward fans of 1990s-2000s indie-grunge-garage,
                            and that's not where I live. I miss the diversity of styles of Guitar Hero
                            (and the diversity of avatars).
                            I love a mix including psychedelic, blues, new wave, glam, hair metal, progressive,
                            and downright weird.</p>
                        <p>
                            There's some more variety in DLC, but the business model means those tracks are
                            included based on projected sales, so they cater to existing requests rather than
                            introducing people to new things. All in all, I found classic guitar hero a better place
                            for new music suggestions. Which is fine, but also a reason I didn't buy Rocksmith until
                            it was on sale for 60% off.
                            The first game is also a bit weird in that everyone is male,
                            from the tutorial guy to the guitarist in the opening demo to most of the vocalists.
                            Rhythm games have been around a long time;
                            this kind of branding is relatively new to the genre, and,
                            since it coincides with mainstream acceptance of rhythm games as 'real' games
                            (in this country, at least),
                            a bit depressing.
                            But that's a whole other blogpost that I probably don't have the energy to write.
                            Not everyone is male in the intro video of the 2014
                            one, at least, so I guess someone pointed it out as weird.</p>
                        
                            <p>
                            Anyway, Rocksmith can help you to hit the right notes,
                            it can help you to hit notes at the right time,
                            and it can help you to hit the right notes at the right time.
                            It probably can't help you go from that to sounding *good*.
                            But it's a start. 
                            Plus it's motivated my partner to try learning the guitar again,
                            so maybe I'll get a jam buddy sometime. :)</p>
