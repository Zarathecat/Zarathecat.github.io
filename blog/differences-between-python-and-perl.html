                                Some Differences between Python and Perl

                        </h4>
                        <p><i>26.02.17</i></p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Recently, I was tasked with sketching out the groundwork
                        for translating a Perl library to a Python library in a 
                        week.
                        I didn't know any Perl
                        when I started, but I'm more
                        used to 'translate this codebase from language A to language B'
                        where I'm new to language A <i>and</i> language B,
                        so it was almost relaxing. :) At
                        least this time I had some Python!</p>

                        <p>Needless to say, I didn't get very far with it, but I learned
                        a lot, so this is a short post on some differences I've found betweeen
                        Python and Perl. I figured it might be useful to note these
                        things somewhere I can find them again. They are in no particular
                        order.</p>

                        <p>I am (obviously!) not an expert. Take this post with a grain of
                        salt.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>1. Typing</h4>

                        <p> My notes here are not in-depth. Python and perl handle types a bit
                        differently. When asked to operate on two variables with
                        different types, Perl automatically converts one of them to
                        match the other, performs the  operation, and then changes
                        the variable back to its original type.
                        So if you add an int to a string, eg:</p>

                        <p><code>"123"+1</code></p>

                        <p>Perl will convert "123" to 123, do 123 + 1 to get 124, and then
                        convert that back, for a result of "124".</p>

                        <p>In Python, if you do <code>"123" + 1</code>, you will get a TypeError
                        , as the types don't match. You could either do 
                        <code>"123" + "1"</code> for string concatenation ("1231") 
                        or <code>123+1</code> for
                        addition (124).</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>2. Variable Names</h4>

                        <p>You've probably seen this around: Perl likes special characters.
                        Variables in Perl are prefixed by special characters denoting
                        their types; <code>@</code> connotes an array, <code>$</code> 
                        connotes a scalar (single value- could be a number, could be a string),
                        etc. So:</p>

                        <p><code>@dogs</code></p>

                        <p>would be something like:</p>

                        <p><code>dogs = []</code></p>

                        <p>in Python,</p>

                        <p>and</p>

                        <p><code>$foo = 'foo'</code></p>

                        <p>might be </p>

                        <p><code>foo = 'foo'</code></p>

                        <p>And so on. In Perl,<code>&</code> in front of the variable name can be
                         used as
                        the syntax for calling a function, though there are multiple
                        ways to do this. There is one way to call a function in Python:
                        use brackets after the name of the function.<p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>3. Function Declaration</h4>

                        <p>Well, in Perl they're known as subroutines, not functions. So
                        that's handy to know when searching the internet.
                        You define them like:</p>

                        <pre>
sub foo { 
    foobarbaz
}</pre>

                        <p>Any parameters passed to the subroutine exist within it in a list
                        denoted with the <code>@_</code> 'array variable'. You can also see 
                        individual values from that array with the 'indexed scalars', eg:
                        <code>$_[0]</code> and <code>$_[1]</code>, 
                        which mean 'get first thing from list of
                        parameters' and 'get second thing from list of parameters'
                        respectively. Also, the list of parameters becomes an array
                        once referred to with <code>@</code> (we'll come back to the difference
                        between lists and arrays in Perl in a bit).</p>

                        <p>Perl also has a plain old <code>$_</code>, 
                         which is a default variable used by many things. 
                         There is also <code>$1</code>, which can be used to get the 
                         first thing matched in the most recently run regexp.</p>

                        <p>Anyway.</p>

                        <p>You could call a subroutine like:</p>

                        <p><code>&makesounds('quack', 'moo');</code></p>

                        <p>and that subroutine might be defined like:</p>

                        <pre>
sub makesounds {
    local(@listofsounds)
    @listofsounds = @_
    local($ducksound)
    $ducksound = $_[0]
}</pre>

                        <p>In python, the equivalent call would be:</p>

                        <p><code>make_sounds('quack', 'moo')</code></p>

                        <p>and the equivalent definition:</p>

                        <pre>
def make_sounds(sound_1, sound_2):
    list_of_sounds = [sound_1, sound_2]
    duck_sound = sound_1</pre>
                            

                        <p>you could do this in a lot of different ways, but that shows
                        how things are passed. 
                        (You wouldn't need the explicit `list_of_sounds` there, for a start)
                        In python, variables are scoped to
                        the function in which they are defined, by default, and
                        it's preferable to call things by name than by position passed.</p>

                        <p>Python functions always return None,
                        unless they they are explicitly told to return a value.
                        Perl subroutines always return a value,
                        which will be the last thing evaluated in the subroutine.</p>
                        <br>



                        <h4>4. Arrays and Lists</h4>

                        <p>Arrays and lists are not the same thing in Perl, even though
                        these names are used interchangeably for other languages (and
                        are frequently used interchangeably in info about Perl, for some
                        reason). Perl's arrays are like python's lists. Perl's lists are
                        more like python's tuples (eg: lists are immutable). 
                        There are some differences,
                        but that's my mental model of them at the moment. Square brackets
                        denote arrays; curved brackets denote lists. There are better
                        guides to these elsewhere on the internet. The guide I visited
                        the most was:
                         <a href="http://friedo.com/blog/2013/07/arrays-vs-lists-in-perl">this one</a>
                         </p>
                        <br>


                        <h4>5. Perl has a library called Mouse that has nothing to do with
                           the mouse</h4>

                        <p>This library extends perl's object-oriented programming (OOP)
                        support to make it easier to 
                        assign attributes to classes and things. Many features covered by
                        Mouse are builtin in Python. As you can see, I'm still sketchy on
                        the details. </p>

                        <p>Classes themselves are Perl packages;
                        they list methods (subroutines), including an object constructor
                        method, to make an instance of the class. The constructor can
                        have any name you want. 
                        If you name the constructor method 'new', then to create
                        an instance of the class, you could do:<p>


                        <p><code>$new_class_instance = ClassName -> new();</code></p>

                        <p>The class(/package) 
                        name is passed as the first argument to any methods in the class.<p>

                        <p>In Python, a class is just a class, and the constructor is always
                        the
                        <code>__init__</code> method; to create an instance of the class, you do:</p>

                        <p><code>new_class_instance = ClassName()</code></p>

                        <p>In Python, the class will be passed to
                        any of the class's methods that take 'self' as a parameter. This
                        must be explicit in the definition of the method, but does
                        not need to be listed when the method is called. So this:</p>

<pre>
class Foo:

    def __init__(self, param):
        self.name = param

    def test(self):
        print self.name

Foo('foo').test()</pre>

                        <p>will happily print 'foo', as it creates an instance of the Foo class
                        and then runs that instance's 'test' method. You don't need to
                        explicitly pass it 'self' in the call, or call <code>__init__()</code> by name.</p>

                        <p>A misc note that doesn't fit in anywhere else nicely:
                        in Python, you can have an array of arrays. 
                        In Perl, arrays are always 1D; you would not have an array of
                        arrays, but instead an array of references [to arrays].</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>6. Asserts</h4>

                        <p>Perl doesn't have asserts built in. Instead, it uses the <code>TestMore</code>
                        library, specifically the function <code>ok()</code>. Sometimes <code>is()</code> is used
                        instead, which is synonymous. So this also shouldn't be confused
                        with the python <code>is</code>, which is roughly a test for equality 
                        (to be precise, <code>is</code> in python checks that two variables point to
                         the same object; <code>==</code> checks that both variables pointed to are 
                        equal. These are referred to as 'reference equality' and 'value
                        equality' respectively, and catch me out about once a week.).</p>

                        <p>Misc note #2:
                        for Perl code, the <code>Carp</code> library is used for various 
                        exception-handling things;
                        <code>croak</code>, <code>confess</code> and <code>cluck</code> 
                        are all part of this library, 
                        so that's what's going on if you see those in some code.
                        Python code tends to include `try... except` blocks for this sort of thing.</p>
                        <br>
                            
                        <h4>7. String concatenation</h4>

                        <p>Perl uses the dot operator, eg:</p>

                        <p><code>'foo' . 'bar'</code></p>

                        <p>would be 'foobar'</p>

                        <p>python uses the +:</p>

                        <p><code>'foo' + 'bar'</code></p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>8. Ranges</h4>

                        <p>In Python, a range is indicated with the range function, which 
                        starts at the first argument and counts up to (but not including)
                        the second (with a third argument as an optional 'step').
                        To get the numbers 1 to 5, you would do:</p>

                        <p><code>range(1, 6)</code></p>

                        and to get every odd number from 1 to 10, you would do:

                        <p><code>range(1, 11, 2)</code></p> 

                        <p>(ie: that starts at 1, stops before it reaches 11, 
                        and goes up in steps of 2)</p>


                        <p>in Perl, the two dot operator is used. It is inclusive; to
                        print out numbers 1 to 5, you would do:</p>

                        <p><code>my @numbers = (1 .. 5);</code></p>

                        <p>there is no 'step' option. You would have to combine the two dot operator
                        with other things.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>9. Do Nothing</h4>

                        <p>In Python, to indicate unimplemented code that should be skipped
                        over, you use the pass keyword:</p>

                        <pre>
def foo():
    pass
                        </pre>

                        <p>in Perl, you would use a triple dot:</p>

                        <pre>
sub foo {
    ...
}
                        </pre>


                        <p>Both the two dot and triple dot operators have a couple of other
                        uses; see <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2014/01/dots-perl/">
                        perlhacks</a> for more (and for more details on the ones I've mentioned).</p>

                        <h4>10. There's More Than One Way To Do Things</h4>

                        <p>If you call a method from a class in Python, the order you write
                        things is fixed
                        and you need to include the brackets. In Perl, things are more
                        fluid. For example, something like:</p>

                        <p><code>Animals.list_animal()</code> in Python</p>

                        <p>could become</p>

                        <p><code>Animals -> list_animal();</code> in Perl</p>
                        <p> BUT </p>
                        <p><code>list_animal Animals</code> is an alternative that should work the same way.</p>
                        <p>This is known as indirect object invocation. It gets interesting when
                        you are calling methods with multiple parameters and soforth.</p>

                        <h4> 11. Whitespace </h4>
                        <p> In Python, whitespace conveys scope. In perl, it does not.</p>

                        <p> Well, those are the ones I've hit so far that I feel I understand well enough
                        to write about in <i>some</i> capacity. If there are errors, feel free to email
                        me; I'm not an expert and I don't pretend to be! Hopefully this is still
                        useful to someone, even if that someone is just future-me.</p>
