                        <p><i> I was tidying up some folders earlier today and came across
                        this half-finished blogpost, written just after I got back from 
                        the OpenStack
                        PTG in Atlanta, that apparently I never got round to actually
                        posting. So... better late than never, I guess? Here it is.</i></p>

                        <p> Last week, I attended the first OpenStack PTG (project teams
                        gathering)! It was great! </p>

                        <p>Previously, we had one event every 6 months: the OpenStack
                        Summit. This was a big gathering, and it could take a day or two
                        just to make a personal schedule of sessions you wanted to attend.
                        The attendees were a mix of developers, managers, marketing and
                        sales staff,
                        recruiters, people-new-to-OpenStack-who-were-curious-about-it,
                        press, live bands, ice-cream trucks, etc</p>

                        <p> This meant things were *busy*. It was pretty common to run
                        around all over the venue trying to catch different sessions,
                        struggling to find people you wanted to talk to, or starting a
                        conversation only for it to be interrupted after 10 seconds by
                        someone else or a busy timetable.</p>

                        <p> Along with the summit, there were also quieter, 'midcycle'
                        events, organised by each project team. These were designed to
                        make progress on specific work items that required people on a
                        project to be in the same room. We did some of these for 
                        StoryBoard, and they were pretty successful; we planned out a
                        lot of development, sent a lot of patches, and most importantly,
                        ate a lot of cake and gummy sweets.</p>

                        <p> However, since these midcycle events were organised per-team, 
                        there were many different midcycles in different
                        countries, all with schedules that could conflict with each other
                        or with other unrelated events.
                        Therefore, it was difficult
                        to attend multiple midcycle events, and thus cross-project work
                        suffered.</p>

                        <p> Enter the PTG. This is a developer-oriented, cross-project
                        event, aimed at bringing all OpenStack developers into the
                        same venue for a week to focus on the technical issues. 
                        While non-developers can attend, 
                        in general they will only get value from it if they have enough
                        context to know why they specifically should
                        be there. In general, if you are not a developer, and you don't 
                        know if you should be there, you probably shouldn't (because
                        you'll be bored with nothing to do!). There is still 
                        <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/">the
                        OpenStack Summit</a>
                        every six months-- an event geared toward cross-project
                        communication, new-contributor onboarding, presenting new features,
                        business discussions, etc.</p>

                        <p> I felt I had much more productive conversations at the PTG
                        than I had at previous summits, as people could focus better, 
                        and were more relaxed. OpenStack is always theatrical,
                        but a focused audience meant that participants were less worried
                        about presenting material to satisfy multiple audiences,
                        and could just get on with work.</p>

                        <p>There wasn't a global schedule of sessions; project teams just
                        each took a room, and organised agenda items in a way that made
                        the most sense to them. In the infra room, for example, fungi
                        read out the items on the agenda at the start of the first day,
                        and then we split off into groups to discuss the things relevant
                        to us and work on them. Most of the room huddled round to talk about zuulv3 and
                        work on specific things that jeblair had listed. People came up to
                        me to ask me about StoryBoard things, and in the gaps I sat near
                        the Zuul team, since I'm interested in the project, even if I'm
                        not directly involved at the moment. Sadly, I didn't succeed in 
                        learning the codebase through osmosis, but it was nice seeing
                        people looking happy when it got just that little bit closer to ready. :)</p>

                        <p> The thing I enjoyed most, though, was being able to catch up
                        with people and have long, uninterrupted conversations. It was
                        great to actually get to know people instead of having a 30
                        second 'hey, how are you?' 'I'm good, how are you?' 'fine, gotta
                        go' in a hallway. The hours were much the same (roughly 9am-1am
                        for me), but the quality of interactions was much higher, and
                        it was possible to discuss technical details at length in a
                        relaxed environment. We
                        spent the time between 6pm and 1am quiet restuarants and bars with 
                        small groups of people, instead of at big vendor-sponsored
                        parties where it was too loud to talk. At these sorts of events,
                        hundreds of introverts pretend to be extroverts for a week,
                        then spend a few more weeks alone at home recovering from the
                        amount of social interaction. :) So, if an event makes it easy
                        for attendees to branch off into small groups when they start
                        feeling tired, those attendees are less likely to get burned out 
                        before the end 
                        of the week, and actually end up participating *more* overall.</p>

                        <p>This atmosphere was fantastic when
                        meeting new people and discussing collaborating on projects. 
                        When I'm choosing projects to use, a tool is more appealing when 
                        multiple parties are interested in developing it, and, in my experience, 
                        fledgling projects tend
                        not to attract contributors based on technology, but based on
                        the people involved. In other words, software is a collaborative endeavour,
                        and many people pick projects (and companies!) based on 
                        whom they like working 
                        with (especially as a project in its early stages may 
                        require contributions in its participants' free time; if
                        you're going to give up your evening, you want to have fun
                        doing it).</p>
