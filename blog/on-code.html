                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> I haven't been coding for all that long,
                            but I've found that writing a program has a lot in common with writing, well, words.</p>
                        <p> People imply that writing skill has little overlap with coding skill,
                            but I doubt this; writing a program with understandable control flow
                            requires a similar process to
                            writing out a clear explanatory paragraph.
                            This is because clear code and clear writing require empathy for the reader.
                            I think it's just a question of <i>noticing</i> confusing things
                            -- and that comes with practice.
                            Here are some things I personally look out for in my technical docs.
                        </p>
                        <p> I'll skip the obvious things
                            ("don't waffle",
                            "use terms most readers can understand")
                            in favour of two things that are slightly less obvious,
                            so that I'm not repeating advice you can find everywhere else on the internet.</p>
                        <p> It's still not groundbreaking.
                            But maybe it's useful to somebody!
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> First thing:
                            ordering information.</p>
                        <p> Written documents can be disorganised
                            in the same way that a program can be disorganised.
                            This is obvious when whole paragraphs leap around
                            (and most people can notice and fix that),
                            but there's also such a thing as a disorganised sentence.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate with an example,
                            here are two imaginary pieces of documentation:
                        <p> #1</p>
                            <blockquote> First, install foo. Next, do the thing.
                                         Now, do the other thing. Finally, do the last thing.</blockquote>
                        <p>#2</p>
                            <blockquote> Do the thing. Before you do the last thing, do this thing.
                                         Do the other thing.</blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p> How many times have you been burned by something like the second example?
                            What if I rephrase it like this:</p>
                        <blockquote> Run the command. Before you do that, make sure you've set
                                     your environment variable 'x' to 'y'. Now, run the script
                                     baz.py. You will need foo installed for this to work.</blockquote>
                        <p>? I see this <i>all</i> the time. It's the written-word equivalent of spaghetti code.</p>
                        <p> Nobody sets out to write spaghetti code;
                            it happens when people add things as they go along
                            because it wasn't possible to plan.</p>                        
                        <p> I see lots of documentation like the latter example,
                            and I understand how it happens.
                            People write the steps down in the order that the steps come to mind,
                            and sometimes people write a later step
                            before remembering an earlier step.
                            Sometimes another person tacks an earlier step onto the end.</p>
                        <p> That's a normal way to start...
                            and it's much like doing the first sketch of a program
                            (or the flow-chart for a program),
                            before you remember extra things to add,
                            and neaten it up.
                            It's important to reorder things before publishing,
                            so that someone can read instructions in the order of execution*.</p>
                        <p> Writing in order also helps combat ambiguity.
                            In the second sentence of the second example, it's not obvious what 'last'
                            refers to. The previous instruction? Or the final step?
                            It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts those sentences in a sensible order.</p>
                        <p> I think people skip the 'tidy up the order' step
                            either because:
                            a) They don't notice it
                            or
                            b) Documentation is perceived as less important;
                               the bar is set so low that 
                               people are praised for writing any docs at all.
                               Therefore, people don't set time aside for polishing docs.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p> Along with writing programs in a sensible order,
                            it's good practice to use meaningful variable names.
                            For example, if you have a function that builds a system,
                            call it 'build_system()', not 'moomoomoo()'.
                            That's common knowledge.
                            But there's a written-word equivalent,
                            that is under-used:
                            referring to a subject or object by name,
                            rather than pronoun.</p>
                        <p> This isn't always necessary,
                            but it matters when the sentence structure could cause ambiguity.</p>
                        <p> To illustrate, here's an example,
                           quoted from above:</p>
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts <i>those sentences</i> in a sensible order
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> In that example,
                            in place of the italicised text,
                            the writer could use 'them':
                        <blockquote>It's much easier to make subjects of sentences clear
                            if the writer puts them in a sensible order</blockquote>
                            But that would be harder to skim.
                            A tired reader might think
                            'them' referred to 'subjects'.</p>
                        <p> If you constantly need to refer to things by name,
                            and your prose is getting dry,
                            it's a sign that you should reorder some sentences.
                            Much like how,
                            if a line of code is 500 characters long,
                            the answer isn't to shorten all the variable names to 1 letter,
                            but to split the line up into smaller functions.</p>
                        <p> Well, that's that. I've listed a couple of things that slow
                            readers down when they're trying to scan for important information,
                            that I personally try to avoid.
                            The first is always worth fixing.
                            The second is more of a 'be aware of this and use your judgement' case;
                            you can go too far with it and end up with 'legalese'
                            that's even harder to follow. So be careful!</p>
                        <p> Anyway, when writing technical documentation,
                            the world will thank you
                            if you assume your reader is an insomniac
                            who is operating on about 0.000001% of their potential brainpower
                            (this is me on any given day).</p>
                        <p> That way,
                            us insomniacs will still be able to follow it,
                            and the rest of the world will be able to follow it <i>easily</i>. :)</p>

                            and if/else statements
                            to list comprehensions,
                            even though list comprehensions are more 'pythonic'.
                            The syntax for list comprehensions
                            means that my brain has to jump back and forth.</p>
                        <p> A 'for' loop with if/else goes:
                            <blockquote>for a thing, in this set of things,
                                if x is the case,
                                    do y.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> You can easily lay that out as a series of questions,
                            progressing with each 'yes' answer
                            (and abandoning with any 'no'):</p>
                        <p> 'Here's a thing-- is it in this set? Yes! Is x the case? Yes! Okay, do y.'</p>
                        <p> The list comprehension equivalent is:
                            <blockquote>do y,
                                            for a thing, in this set of things,
                                                if x is the case.</blockquote></p>
                        <p> The questions layout doesn't work here.
                            I find the order hard to keep track of.</p>
                        <p> Maybe this order is preferable when trying to see why something did 'y',
                            and it's designed around debugging.</p>
                        <p> It feels like the reverse of the
                            order in which the instructions are evaluated and executed.
                            And it's the reverse of the order I would interpret an instruction.
                            The criteria that need to be satisfied
                            feel like bracketed afterthoughts,
                            but computers tend not to go,
                            'Okay,
                            I'll run this command
                            and then I'll see if
                            the if statement evaluates to True or False'
                            (and if your computer <i>does</i> behave like this,
                            take it back to the shop).</p>
                            <p>For a more natural languagey example, compare:
                            <blockquote> For each shop, on this street,
                                         if the shop stocks fabric,
                                         go inside the shop</blockquote>
                            to
                            <blockquote> Go inside the shop,
                                         for each shop, on this street,

                        <p> I suppose my ideal would be:
                        <blockquote> On this street,
                                     for each shop,
                                     if the shop stocks fabric,
                                     go inside the shop.</blockquote>
                        </p>

                    </div>
