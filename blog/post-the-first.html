                        <br>
                        <p> I've started blogs in the past.
                            What tends to happen is that I make, say, an art blog,
                            post a few things,
                            and then go on a music kick for ages.
                            By the time I get back to art, 
                            the blog is ancient</p>
                        <p> So, this website is my attempt to avoid that sad fate,
                            by having sections for multiple interests.
                            There might be times when I only update the music
                            section, or the games section, and so-on.</p>
                        <p> At some point I'll revamp this so that it contains
                            proper tags and soforth... But I won't stress over
                            it until I have some actual content.</p>
