                        <p> This week, <a href="https://dmsimard.com/">David Moreau Simard (irc: dmsimard)</a>
                            was kind enough to
                            praise our work over the last few months on the UI and UX for StoryBoard!
                            <a href="http://sotk.co.uk/about/">Adam Coldrick (irc: SotK)</a> and I* especially enjoy compliments like these,
                            as StoryBoard has been our first foray into frontend development,
                            and we've had to figure out a lot as we've gone along.</p>
                            <p>The company where we work specialises in systems engineering,
                            so we've been very fortunate to gain experience in web-development via working on OpenStack.
                            We've had the opportunity to learn about the web-development
                            ecosystem from people such as <a href="https://krotscheck.net/">Michael Krotscheck </a>
                            (who has both taught us a lot and developed the bulk of StoryBoard before we were involved with the project),
                            and <a href="http://www.logicative.com/">Beth Elwell</a> (who sends UI patches to StoryBoard as a relaxation method!).</p> 
                        
                            <p>So, anyway, we got a compliment!
                               After I'd finished calling up everyone I knew,
                               and telling them to read irc RIGHT NOW,
                               I started wondering: how do we do stuff?
                                For UI and UX design,
                            can we offer any pointers to teams in the same position we were a year ago?</p>
                            <p>I'll probably do this as a series of posts, as and when I remember things. So!
                            Here's the first. I think it's the most important thing,
                            and we saved a lot of time by starting to work this way early on.</p>
                        <p><b>TIP: Dig to find out the actual problem</b></p>
                        <p> There is a fitting Neil Gaiman quote;
                             it's his fourth suggestion over here:</p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one/"><i>
                                "Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them,
                                they are almost always right. 
                                When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it,
                                they are almost always wrong"
                            </i></a></p>
                            <p> -- Neil Gaiman
                            </p>
                         <p> So, that's a quote about creative writing-- but we can generalise!
                             When users have an issue, they will suggest specific implementation changes.
                             When that happens, it's good to step back and establish what they're trying to do and
                             why. 
                             Identifying the root problem allows you to fix the same issue in all its guises,
                             instead of moving buttons around and back again as you try to satisfy contradictory
                             implementation suggestions.
                             Often, you'll find the best change is nothing like the original suggestion.</p>
                        <p>  You need to be active and engaged during this process;
                             it's obvious when people reply with questions for the sake of it, like this:</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  User: Argh, the 'create new task' button is on the left; all the other buttons live
                                   on the right; it's annoying; can it go on the left, too?</p>
                        <p>  Developer: So, what do you want to do when you click that button?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  Well, obviously they want to create a task. Like all development methodologies, don't
                             follow this one dogmatically in cases where it makes no sense. :) Similarly...</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  User: When I search for a tag, it doesn't show all things matching the tag I specify. It should do.</p>
                        <p>  Developer: Why do you want the software to return all things matching the tag, instead of just some?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  That's an extreme example, just to show that you shouldn't ask questions
                             without paying attention, trying to empathise with the user, and attempting
                             to make yourself familiar with the process they want to perform.
                             There *are* related questions that would make sense in that scenario, eg:</p>
                        <div><i>
                        <p>  Developer: Okay, you want a list of everything that matches that tag. Out of interest, how do you then use that
                                        list?</p></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>  The user will say something unexpected,
                             and this will reveal a *lot* about how you should present the list.
                             For example, the user might want it laid out a certain way so it'll behave nicely
                             when pasted into some other service, in which case it might be better to
                             create an interface for other services (otherwise, the next user will want a different
                             layout, and the next, etc).
                             You might discover that your software can already solve their problem,
                             as it has this interface already,
                             and you need to draw more attention to the interface.
                             Or, the user might plan to do something with the list that your
                             software can't yet do, in which case you have an early heads-up for a bigger feature request.
</p>
                             <p>
                             So, at this point, you note the use-case; if it seems like a good thing to fix,
                             you plan to implement the fix. If not, you raise your reservations with the user;
                             sometimes one of you will change your mind, sometimes not. If you still don't feel convinced,
                             you put it on the backburner, and wait to see if
                             a chorus of other people raise the same issue-- in which case should also discuss the
                             reservations with them, see what they say, and revisit your assumptions as necessary.</p>
                        <p> You need to be careful with this process. Firstly, if you ask questions just to try to change
                        someone's mind, they will pick up on it and you won't have a productive discussion; you have to 
                        go in with an open mind and be humble about your opinions. Secondly, you should respect the user's
                        time; if the discussion takes too long,
                            the user can get frustrated and think 'other software does this
                            like x, so why can't this team just implement it like x?'. But that ignores the original motivation
                            *not* to use that other piece of software-- people wanted a better implementation,
                            not more of the same. </p>
                        <p>Well, that's that! Hopefully, this will help you feel less overwhelmed when lots of users have
                        different opinions, and you'll be able to discuss and change things more efficiently. Good luck!</p>
